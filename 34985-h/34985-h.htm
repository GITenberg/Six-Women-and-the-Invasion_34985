<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This little book gives a very graphic and interesting
account by an eye-witness&mdash;who knows how
to write!&mdash;of life in the occupied provinces of
France under the daily pressure of the German
invasion. There are many repulsive and odious
incidents recorded here of the German occupation,
but, mercifully, few "atrocities," such as
those which make of the French Governmental
Reports, or that of the Bryce Commission, tales
of horror and infamy that time will never wash
out. These pages relate to the neighbourhood
of Laon, and the worst brutalities committed
by German soldiers in France seem to have
happened farther south, along the line of the
German retreat during the battle of the Marne,
and in the border villages of Lorraine. But
the picture drawn of the Germans in possession
of a French country district, robbing and bullying
its inhabitants, and delighting in all the
petty tyrannies of their military régime, is one
that writes in large-hand the lesson of this war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
"There must be no next time!" If Europe
cannot protect itself in future against such
conduct on the part of a European nation,
civilisation is doomed.</p>

<p>And that this little book under-states the
case rather than over-states it, can be proved by
a mass of contemporary evidence. I pass for
instance from Madame Yerta's graphic account
of the endless "requisitions," "perquisitions,"
"inquisitions," to which the inhabitants of Morny
in the Laonnois were subject in 1915, to a
paragraph in this week's <i>Morning Post</i> (Tuesday,
September 18), where a letter found upon a
German soldier, and written to a comrade in
Flanders from this very district, gleefully says:
"We take from the French population all their
lead, tin, copper, cork, oil, candlesticks, kitchen
pots, or anything at all like that, which is sent
off to Germany. I had a good haul the other
day with one of my comrades. In one walled-up
room we found fifteen copper musical instruments,
a new bicycle, 150 pairs of sheets, some
towels, and six candlesticks of beaten copper.
You can imagine the kind of noise the old hag
made who owned them. I just laughed. The
Commandant was very pleased."</p>

<p>No doubt the Commandant was of the same
race as the Von Bernhausens or the Bubenpechs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
whom Madame Yerta pillories in these lively
and sarcastic pages. It would be too much
indeed to expect that any Frenchwoman who had
passed through fifteen months of such a life
should write with complete impartiality of her
temporary masters. She would be less than
human were it possible. Yet in the sketches of
the two German officers "Barbu" and "Crafleux,"
billeted on the "six women," there is no more
than a laughing malice, and an evident intention
to be fair to men who had no evident intention
to be cruel. But of the bullying Commandant,
Lieutenant von Bernhausen, and of the officer,
Lieutenant Bubenpech, who succeeded him as
the absolute master of the French village which
is the scene of the book, Madame Yerta gives
us portraits in which every touch bites. The
drunken, sensual manners of such men, combined
with German conceit and German arrogance,
make up a type of character only too real, only
too common, to which throughout the districts
where the Germans have passed, French experience
bears inexorable and damning witness.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that these six brave women&mdash;Madame
Valaine, her four daughters and her
daughter-in-law, the writer of the book&mdash;were
well able to take care of themselves. The tale
of their courage, their gaiety, their resource under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the endless difficulties and petty oppressions of
their lot, lights up the miserable scene, kindling
in the reader the same longing for retribution
and justice on a barbarian race, as burnt in their
French hearts.</p>

<p>Madame Yerta describes for us how neighbours
helped each other, how they met in the farm
kitchens, behind their closed doors and windows,
to pass on such news as they could get, to pray
for France, and scoff at the invader; how they
ingeniously hid their most treasured possessions,
how they went hungry and cold because the
Germans had robbed them of food, clothing and
blankets&mdash;(they are doing it afresh at this very
moment in occupied France and Belgium!)&mdash;and
how village and town alike would have
starved but for the Spanish-American Relief
Commission.</p>

<p>The result is a typically French book, both
in its lightness of touch and in the passionate
feeling that breaks through its pages. The old
Latin civilisation makes the background of it&mdash;with
its deeply rooted traditions, its gifts of
laughter and of scorn, its sense of manners and
measure, its humanity, its indomitable spirit.
When the writer at last, after fifteen months of
bondage, sees once more the fields of "la douce
France," she puts simply and sharply into words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the thoughts and sufferings of thousands&mdash;thousands
of ill-treated, innocent and oppressed
folk&mdash;to whom, as we pray, the course of this
just war will before long bring comfort and
release.</p>

<p>Her book deserves a wide audience, and will,
I hope, find it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>As you know only too well, in the year 1914
war set Europe on fire. That is to say, you the
men made war, and we the women had but
to comply. Let us be honest and true: whereas
you, heart of my heart, now gone to fight for
your country, wished for this contest with the
enthusiasm, spirit, and rage of youth, I wished
for it too, but with terror, anguish, and remorse.
Such is the difference.</p>

<p>The Place? The Île de France, the part of
my country blessed among all, sweeter to my
eyes than the most loudly sung; and in the
Île de France, Morny, a village of the Laonnois,
situated on a level plain. At ten miles' distance,
to the west of Morny, Laon is perched on a steep
low hill. To the north, fields and meadows
stretch out as far as the eye can reach, and
towards the south, the forest of St. Gobain makes
a long dark blot on the landscape; beyond, a
blue line of mountains closes the horizon like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a wall. This peaceful scene, with its green
meadows, fertile fields, rich forests, villages
nestling among orchards, with its good-humoured
tenants wrapt up in a love of their country, sums
up the treasures of the Île de France. But it is
also "the seasoning of the French pie, this rotten
ferment whose canker-like nature, frivolity, inconstancy,
and folly, have spread into the noblest
parts of France." You were not aware of this?
No more was I, but I learned it from Hummel's
<i>Geography</i>, published in 1876 for "German
families," and it is a conviction that Teutonic
babies imbibe with their mothers' milk.</p>

<p>The <i>dramatis personae</i>? Six women, I have
said. My mother-in-law, her four daughters, and
I. Let me introduce them. Mme. Valaine, my
mother-in-law, charms by her gentle dignity and
by her handsome face, still young under waving
grey hair. As to her daughters, when they all
were little girls in pinafores, an old woman once
cried out at the sight of their childish beauty,
"One is prettier than another." To which my
husband&mdash;at that time a teasing schoolboy&mdash;retorted,
"One is naughtier than another."
We do not believe this last assertion. I will
only maintain that their beauty has grown with
them.</p>

<p>Geneviève, the eldest, is my favourite sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
another me; and for a long while we have
not been able to do without one another. A
supple shape, a lovely expressive face fringed
with golden hair, clear eyes between black eyelashes,
added to a fine intellect and well-poised
faculties, make of her a privileged being. Her
steadfast character always deals straightforwardly,
whereas mine, just as tenacious, does not disdain
man&oelig;uvring.</p>

<p>Her sisters are tall and graceful. Yvonne has
large black eyes, a tiny mouth, and splendid
golden locks. She is the musician of the family;
thinks nothing better in the world than the harmony
of sweet sounds, and lives only for her art.
Antoinette bears proudly an imperial beauty and
a bachelor's degree, which she has recently
carried off. As to Colette, the pet child of the
family, by turns charming and execrable, she
counts seventeen summers, and rejoices our eyes
with the sweetest face ever seen, a rose-bud complexion,
and cornflower eyes.</p>

<p>Two representatives of the opposite sex intrude
upon this company of women. My husband
first. He is the tallest, the handsomest of the
sons of men. "When I see him, I think I behold
a young god," said one of our friends a few years
ago; and I shall not cheapen these terms of praise
by any description of him. If I confide to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that he is growing bald on his temples, be sure
you don't go and tell him so; the loss is due to
sojourns in Saigon and Panama; for this half of
myself is a true globe-trotter, and has seen the
whole world&mdash;without me alas! He is a man of
great learning, and is deeply skilled in philology
and theology. Such as he is, I adore him, and
think it better to own it honestly, for fear my
partiality might remain unperceived. The other
specimen of the sterner sex, with whom I have to
deal here, is a small Parisian boy, nine years old,
owner of the most flippant tongue. By a stroke
of carelessness he was sent to us for a fortnight,
and like many another has now to stay as a
prisoner on account of the Invasion.</p>

<p>Out of common politeness I have not yet
mentioned my own person. The task of describing
it is hateful. Of this self fortunately there is
not much&mdash;fifty kilos at the utmost. In other
words, I am slender. I have a pink and white
complexion and very long auburn hair, a small
insignificant nose, a large mouth, and serious
eyes. I am generally called "Grandmother,"
in memory of a time when we acted <i>Little Red
Riding Hood</i>. My husband always calls me Mr.
Monkey, your Poisonous Ladyship, or Mrs. Kid,
vexatious names, truly, for a woman. We live
in Paris the greater part of the year, but it is with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
pleasure that the whole family meets every
summer in our country-house at Morny, to spend
its holidays.</p>

<p>When, about the 20th of July 1914, Geneviève,
Yvonne and I arrived in the dear old place, my
husband and Colette had been enjoying it for a
fortnight; my mother-in-law and Antoinette were
expected shortly. We had taken with us little
Pierre Prat, whose mother, a good friend of ours,
could not leave Paris for the present, and the
health of the interesting boy required the country.
We had hardly exchanged the usual kisses, and
renewed our knowledge of the place, we were
hardly seated at the dinner-table, when Colette
cried out: "Oh, grandmother, how lovely!
Fancy, there will be a war. The day it is declared
I shall dress like a boy and become a soldier!"</p>

<p>"Of course, you will cut your beautiful locks,
besmear your cheeks, and there you are. But
tell me in earnest, Posy, do you think there will
be a war?"</p>

<p>I suppose my husband has a name of his own,
but no one knows it. For the whole family he
is "Brother," and I call him "Posy."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Posy thought war unavoidable, and
began to expound the reasons that strengthened
his opinion.</p>

<p>A little tired of the journey, happy to be again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the country, I listened to the deep sounds
of the dear voice I had not heard for the last
fortnight, but gave little heed to the meaning of
his words. Besides, I was so sure there would be
no war at all! We began to lead a blissful life;
we enjoyed walks in the large garden, and praised
the sun and the green. What delightful holidays
we would have! The mere thought of it
led to lyrism. O Nature! O Idyll! O blessed
rest!</p>

<p>At first nothing happened to trouble our peace.
It will be remembered that the newspapers were
rather encouraging. Optimism prevailed; my
husband alone talked of an impending conflict;
but he wished it so eagerly that I thought he
might be mistaken in his prophecies. "War is
talked of every year," I said; "it is but a summer
topic."</p>

<p>On the 26th of July there were alarming
rumours, confirmed the day after. We then began
to talk of war, to talk always about that, to talk
of nothing else. Colette herself held no other
conversation, and from her crimson lips dropped
no other words than mobilisation, armament,
concentration.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the night when troops
crossed the village. I saw war that night, war,
the man-eater, the great killer, war himself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hour was grave. France was preparing to withstand
her enemies, and was sending her armies to
protect the frontiers. Troops marched through
the village the whole night. First came the foot
soldiers, who filed off to the strains of the "Marseillaise"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and the "Chant du Départ." Leaning</span><br />
out of my window, in a nightgown, I tried to
catch sight of something, and I saw only a black
flood, endlessly rolling on. The sight of this dark
mass which marched on and sang was striking
indeed. The young voices had an accent of
resolution and rage, and gave the impression that
all hearts throbbed as if by one impulse. The
men knew they were marching on to death, and
they sang as the volunteers of '92 may have
sung. Sometimes there was silence, and nothing
was to be heard save the sound of steps as
rhythmical as a heavy shower.</p>

<p>As the first battalion passed, my husband laid
his book aside, lifted up his head, and declared:
"There can be no more doubt of it now."
And resuming his Henri Houssaye and his cigarette,
he buried himself again in his reading.
I was not so easily resigned to the situation. A
certitude had seized upon me too. "It is war."
I was trembling like a leaf, shaken by the wind,
and I could not master my emotion. I was not
frightened, I felt easy in my mind, but my body&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it due to primeval memory, to misgivings, or
to the terrible thought that has been handed
down from wars of yore? I do not know&mdash;but
my frightened body was trembling convulsively.</p>

<p>When I was not leaning out of the window,
I thought, lying by the side of my husband:
"War is coming, may God protect us!" I
clasped his dear head in despair, I kissed him in
an agony, and said over and over again: "War
will carry him off." And I thought: "All over
France the roads are covered with troops, and
thousands of women, close to the man they love,
are listening to the steps of the soldiers and the
rumbling of the cannon; broken-hearted, they
kiss an adored face, and with bitter tears repeat:
'War will carry him off!'"</p>

<p>Cavalry followed infantry; then came gunners,
cannon, and powder-carts. The heavy pieces
rolled on with the noise of thunder, and shook
the house to its foundations. It was about three
o'clock in the morning. A cold mist fell as if
reluctantly from the cloudy sky. The night
was less dark, and the moving forms passed
slowly like shadows before my sight, horses,
cannon, and gunners wrapt up in their cloaks.
Dark in the dark haze, the outlines of men and
animals seemed to sketch a new dance of death,
in the midst of which the grim monster might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
have appeared at any moment. I was so deeply
impressed by this phantasmagorical marching past
that I almost expected to see Death go up behind
a gunner or get astride a cannon. I felt intensely
that I was seeing war, war and death. War,
the terrible tyrant, was marching along, and
nothing would impede his progress.</p>

<p>Still more foot soldiers. The men sing no
more. Dawn is unfavourable to enthusiasm.
You set forth in the evening sanguine of success,
seeing at the end of the road Victory, Triumph,
and Glory. But when morning comes, dark
and cold, your exaltation sinks. Not that
you feel less resolute, but behind the brilliant
phantoms your fancy had conjured up the night
before, you see grimacing slaughter and death
and fire.</p>

<p>Day broke bright and clear. In the sun's
lively beams all fears melted away. There will
be a war? Be it so. The men will go and
fight, and we too will do something for France.
The following week was a medley of enthusiasms
and sadnesses. At last war and revenge were no
more mere words; at last Germany would be
crushed. Too long our enemy had wronged us;
we would wreak a tardy but fearful vengeance
for our still unavenged disgrace, for grievous
humiliations daily inflicted on us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>O revenge, O sun, you rise, and your first rays
make our hearts sing like the granite of old Egypt.
We lived in a fever. War, which approached,
cast its shadow before, but it was a bright shadow,
the shadow of Glory, of more than human courage,
of manifold heroism. It was the pillar of fire
which, shielding our hearts from the enemy and
the terrors to come, hid them from our eyes.
The passing breath of enthusiasm quickened the
beating of our hearts. As to myself, I put a good
face upon the matter, but all the time I thought
with anguish: "It is war. I shall be alone....
War will sever us from all we love, blood and
tears will be shed everywhere. May God save
France, and have pity upon us!"</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August war was an unquestioned
fact: mobilisation was proclaimed. My husband
has served in the Navy, and had to go to Cherbourg
the next day. We then began preparations for
the departure of our sailor, who increased my
cares by saying over and over again: "Don't
expect me to remain in the Navy, there is nothing
to do there. I will be sent to the east of France,
and see the white of the Prussians' eyes."</p>

<p>The luggage being ready, we went for a stroll
in the village. War was of course the one topic
of the day. To qualify them for the toils of Mars,
the men had duly sacrificed to Bacchus, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
patriotism was none the less fiery for that. Most
women were silent. Many had cried their eyes
quite red. One day more, and they would be
alone with groups of small children. A very
young woman, almost a girl, declared with a
toss of her light hair: "Bachelors who have but
their own body to care for ought to go and fight,
that's right, but fathers of a family!..." Her
neighbour next door, Mme. Turgau, nodded
assent. She had a baby in her arms, and was
pensively listening to her husband who, hot with
anger, was speechifying not very far off. In his
quality of orator, he discoursed not only upon
Germans, but upon spies also. In the morning
two Germans had been arrested in Laon, and the
day before a man who was going to blow up a
bridge had been shot. But look! Two strangers
appeared at the corner of the street. All faces
grew serious, and Turgau, advancing towards
the men, demanded their papers. When they
refused to show them, the crowd grew nervous,
and Turgau thought himself insulted. Cries
and bad names filled the air, until the soldiers,
astonished at the uproar, took the culprits away
to examine their papers.</p>

<p>The lover of justice came back home greatly
pleased with himself. People gathered round
him, and declared: "Policemen, gendarmes, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
humbug! Fortunately we are here to maintain
order." And all together they went to the next
inn, and from the adventure drew this moral
lesson: No more strangers, France for Frenchmen!</p>

<p>Pleasant and peaceful, the last evening was
drawing to its close, the last of many evenings
that will never come again. The following morning
I went to the station with my husband.
There was a large crowd on the platform. The
men, high in spirit, seemed delighted to go off
to the army. Silent and gloomy, the women
stood close to their husbands, and their eyes
betrayed a sadness past remedy. Then came
the train, full of soldiers of the reserve, singing
at the top of their voices. All get into the crowded
carriages, a whistle is heard, the train moves forward.
A last kiss, a last handshake. The dear
face leans out of the window, my eyes raised up
towards it, until its features disappear and vanish
in the distance. It is all over; he is gone; they
are gone. Towards Glory, towards Death!
Who knows? I came back home, forlorn and
sad. In vain Colette's endearing words and
Geneviève's warm affection awaited me; love
had deserted the house.</p>

<p>The following days glided by tiresome and
empty, but fortunately we soon found an occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
A regiment of artillery was formed in the
neighbourhood. Two batteries were quartered
in Morny, and willing needlewomen were required
to put the uniforms of the soldiers into good
condition. Very well. There are no opportunities
for high deeds, let us be content with small
ones. We put together needles, scissors, and
thread, and thus armed ran to the school where
other women were already working. And what
work! We were told to shorten trousers, to let
jackets out, to sew stripes, and to stitch numbers
on collars and sleeves. A noisy and merry
activity prevailed in the yard. When off duty,
the soldiers gathered about the big nut-tree,
whose shadow protected the needle-women from
the sun. Harmless jokes were exchanged, and
Germany of course had to bear the brunt of them.
There was a tailor, a giant with a jolly face, who
declared that he would get all he wanted on the
other side of the Rhine, and for a ball of thread
or a missing button would send you straight to
Berlin. These good-natured and simple ways
were all the more touching on account of the
dangers which lay ahead. And, what we highly
appreciated, the soldiers behaved like gentlemen.
We spent many hours with them, and never heard
a rough or coarse word. For truth's sake, I must
say their Captain kept a sharp look-out upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
men. He was about forty-five, had nice eyes
and a kindly face. We heard his name, and
found out that he was a famous man, whose
works we greatly admired. We had common
friends too, and it was not long before we became
real comrades, and told him how eager we were
to be of some use to our country.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we might nurse a few
wounded soldiers in our house?" we asked.</p>

<p>The Captain was good enough to like the idea.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "if your rooms are large
enough and airy."</p>

<p>"Come and see yourself."</p>

<p>The Captain came first alone, and the day
after with two Surgeon-Majors. They made
calculations, and then declared that we might
receive thirty soldiers. Two empty houses our
neighbours offered out of kindness would contain
twenty other beds. Fifty soldiers would compose
quite a sufficient ambulance, and to our
heart's delight we might devote our strength to
the wounded.</p>

<p>"In Laon, they will be only too pleased to
send you convalescents," M. Vinchamps told us;
"plenty of patients will soon fill the hospitals;
and a doctor from the town will come every day
to tend your invalids."</p>

<p>This medical visit did not remain the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
one M. Vinchamps paid us. About nine o'clock,
his day's work over, our new friend came round
and knocked at the window. Our talk was chiefly
on war, the only topic we took an interest in.</p>

<p>"Men are good for nothing," M. Vinchamps
said; "courage is their only gift. That is why
I am delighted with the present war. At peace,
men are out of their right element."</p>

<p>"Then you must improve the occasion, and
make the best of it, for certainly there will be
universal peace after the present war, and you
men will be for ever out of your element."</p>

<p>No one answered, and our silence called up a
picture of dead and wounded stretched upon a
plain where a battle had taken place. And again
we talked of Belgian courage, of that heroic Liége
which had to face such fearful odds, and did not
yield to brute strength. We likened the storming
party to the turbulent waters which beat furiously
against a dyke. But we knew the dyke was strong,
and would not give way.</p>

<p>The Germans were not highly appreciated by
Captain Vinchamps.</p>

<p>"They are not intelligent," he declared.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not. I do not deny their qualities.
They are fine imitators, but no creators. They
make good use of others' inventions, and derive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
benefit from discoveries they would be unable to
make themselves. Their talents&mdash;quite practical&mdash;are
not what is called intelligence. Cuvier,
Pasteur, Lamarck have no rivals on the other side
of the Rhine, and their work no equal. Besides,
consider that for fifty years our neighbours have
thought of but one goal: a victorious war."</p>

<p>"But that is very important just now."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Intelligence will get the better
of brute strength and crush it."</p>

<p>The mere thought of victory sent a thrill of
rapturous joy through our hearts.</p>

<p>On going out through the yard, lit up by the
moon's rays, the Captain listened to the whistle
of the trains, and said with a smile:</p>

<p>"Food for powder!"</p>

<p>At full speed the trains rolled on both lines
day and night; the food for powder went by
without ceasing.</p>

<p>Food for powder!</p>

<p>And yet the expression is not right. For the
soul of every man was awake. At the call of
war all men were ready to fight and to die; all
shouted "victory," in the assurance that it would
come to us.</p>

<p>In the village our confidence met some distrust.
Mme. Tassin, who acts as housekeeper
when we are away, tossed her grey head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was young when I saw <i>them</i> for the first
time in '70. What shall I do at my age if they
come here now?"</p>

<p>Geneviève was filled with horror at the mere
suggestion. In the farm near by Mme. Lantois
expressed the very same unreasonable fears.
"Do you think we shall have them here?" she
asked a young lieutenant, who was as bitterly
disgusted as we were.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our gunners were ready from head
to foot, and their horses from mane to hoof. We
heard the last exhortations of the Captain to his
men, and the next day we got up at four o'clock
in the morning to see them off. It was magnificent.
The sun shone in triumph upon the martial train;
the flower-covered cannon had a good-humoured
air; the horses pawed the ground; and the
gunners had not smiles enough to throw to us,
nor caps enough wherewith to salute us.</p>

<p>Captain Vinchamps, before he took leave,
introduced his horse. It was a "skittish" little
mare, he thought, clever and sweet-tempered.
Once more we wished him success, and once more
hoped that the war would spare him and his
men; and all, soldiers, officers, and horses, galloped
off, and were soon hidden from our sight amid
the poplar trees in the sun and the dust.</p>

<p>The last soldier had departed. The village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was empty of men, and the women from sunrise
to sunset were working in the fields. We led
an uninteresting life. In fact we did not live
in Morny, but in Belgium where our soldiers
were fighting. Our overburdened minds looked
forward passionately to the result of the first
conflict. What was going to happen?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>First came a letter from my husband. He had
written it in the first fever of war. The letter
was a week late, and he marvelled at the splendid
eagerness and union of France. "'Tis the world
upside down," he wrote. "In my detachment,
out of 1200 seamen, not one was missing or drunk
on getting to Cherbourg. As to myself, I am
more decided than ever not to go to sea. I will
see the Prussians face to face. Yesterday I had
a talk with a field officer, and he promised to get
me an interesting post. That is a good thing;
I now depend only on him."</p>

<p>I thought I saw him rubbing his hands with
satisfaction. An interesting post! It means,
doesn't it, to run into jeopardy, to seek after
perilous missions? Oh, dare-devil! oh, heart
of stone! Wrapped up in his joy, he has no
thought for the pangs of those whose hearts are
hanging upon his life!</p>

<p>Soon after there arrived unexpectedly Mme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Valaine and Antoinette, whose journey had been
greatly delayed by the mobilisation. We had
got but scanty news from Paris, and listened in
amazement to their descriptions of the capital,
the fine frenzy of the soldiers leaving for the
front, the plunder of German shops, and then in
our turn told them the little that we had seen in
the country.</p>

<p>When our stories and greetings were finished,
it was time to prepare rooms for the travellers.</p>

<p>I will seize upon the occasion to give a short
description of our dear old house. Notched like
a saw, the gabled front presents a row of shutters,
which, like grey eyelids, secure us from indiscreet
looks. To the right and the left two large iron
gates, always carefully closed, lead one into a
paved yard, the other into a narrow road, planted
with trees. The side of the house, looking out
on the high-walled garden, throws off the reserve
in which the front is shrouded; windows and
doors are always wide open to the air, the sun,
and the creepers, whose branches penetrate even
the rooms themselves. Inside, a passage separates
the house into two parts, the dining- and the
drawing-rooms on one side, and on the other the
bedrooms and the kitchen. Geneviève, Colette,
and Mme. Valaine have their rooms downstairs.
Upstairs the attic has been cut up pleasantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
into three. Outside, parallel with the house, a
small building opens into the yard, containing
a wash-house, a room&mdash;the small room&mdash;a
coach-house, a stable, and the whole is topped
by an attic.</p>

<p>The house&mdash;this does not allow of discussion&mdash;is
too small, or the family is too large, and Antoinette,
who wanted a room to herself, declared:
"I will settle in 'the small room,'" and we could
not get it out of her head, although we enlarged,&mdash;with
some complacency&mdash;upon the dangers she
might run alone by night.</p>

<p>"The walls are high, the doors strong. I am
not afraid, and then there are the dogs."</p>

<p>Indeed, Gracieuse and Percinet, the collies we
dote on, live next door, and have sharp sets
of teeth which they show to all intruders.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma," said Antoinette the next
morning, "last night, about twelve...."</p>

<p>"The proper time for crimes."</p>

<p>"I was startled out of my sleep."</p>

<p>"You were dreaming of the Germans."</p>

<p>"No, no. Some one was in the attic above
my room."</p>

<p>"There you are! A spy! Have you run
him in?"</p>

<p>"Without joking, Grandmamma. I heard steps
quite clearly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know that deserters are said to have
escaped near Morny?"</p>

<p>In process of time the deserters were proved
to be dormice, but we thought the mistake
amusing, and ever after called the attic "the
deserter's attic." Life went on. Dull, spiritless,
insignificant in Morny; immense, tremendous, and
tragical beyond there in the North and the East.
We longed for the postman the whole day long.
He had few letters for us, but he still brought
papers. We read them carefully, and we were
none the wiser. We ought to have read between
the lines, but we could not. I assure you that,
during the end of August, we were deaf and blind.
Our reason refused to believe the testimony of
our senses. We saw thousands and thousands
of people whom Belgium and the North had
cast away, the Belgian army driven back from
Flanders, the staff officers settle in Laon, and
we never came to the right conclusion.</p>

<p>In the case of floods&mdash;long before they are out&mdash;birds
fly with hasty wings, beasts hurry away,
and even snails climb up the trees. Less clever
than the beasts of the field, we were unconscious
of the threatening inundation even when the
country round us already lay under water, and
floating wrecks were visible on all sides.</p>

<p>One morning, at an early hour, we went with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
our arms full of provisions to the station where
seven trains had stopped, crowded with refugees.
In an instant the poor people had stripped us of
our burden, and by way of thanks answered our
anxious questions.</p>

<p>For thirty-six hours they had been travelling,
men, women, old people, children, invalids,
crowded in the narrow carriages, and yet they
were happy to get away, to escape, as they
thought, from a nightmare. Furious bombardments,
pitiless fights, burning villages&mdash;they had
witnessed, and told to us all the horrors of war.
They had seen corpses in some places so thickly
packed that they remained standing, and the
sight haunted them, as did the horrible smell of
hundreds of dead bodies burning on funeral piles,
or floating in long files down rivers of sinister
aspect.</p>

<p>For the first time we realised the actual
atrocity of war, and with a shrinking of the
heart we eagerly questioned the lieutenant who
convoyed the train, as to what had happened.</p>

<p>"Madam, I know nothing. I have been told an
important battle is imminent. Belgium is in ruins."</p>

<p>"And we shall not go to Germany, and impose
upon the aggressors the law of retaliation!"</p>

<p>"Of course we shall. Be patient. They shall
rue it dearly. But when?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The hordes that covered the roads were still
more miserable than the travellers we had just
seen.</p>

<p>Day after day they trudged grimly along.
We saw vehicles of all kinds, carriages, carts,
wains drawn by horses, oxen, donkeys, and even
dogs, loaded and overloaded with women, children,
sick people, huddled together with old clothes,
kitchen utensils, articles of food for the people,
and straw for the animals. The men relieved
the sorry jades by pushing or pulling, and on
both sides of the road rolled a flood of ragamuffins.
The women, with urchins hanging on
to their skirts, bore babies in their arms; boys and
girls rode on bicycles; with great toil old and
infirm people dragged along heaps of shapeless
burdens, tools, saucepans, and the most unexpected
objects of every kind.</p>

<p>They went on without rest, and with only one
wish, to get farther away, and the very dogs
followed, lolling their tongues out, their tails
curled between their legs, with a feeling of the
universal distress visible in their eyes.</p>

<p>Some faces looked tragical, even desperate,
but on most of them was impressed a gloomy
resignation.</p>

<p>"The Prussians are coming!" they had heard,
and snatching some hastily made parcels, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had fled away with no other purpose than
flight.</p>

<p>They were but a distracted herd, flying from
a destroying wave; they possessed neither
hearth nor home. All that they had was lost,
burnt, plundered, and every one of them was
but a cypher in the nameless crowd that besought
the pity of France.</p>

<p>This human torrent had its dregs. There was
no excuse for those who were harsh to the
fugitives&mdash;and they were plenty&mdash;but society
was upset, and the worst elements came to the
surface. Plunder-fed vagabonds, always to be
met in public calamities, profited by the woes
of others, filched from the rich, took toll even of
the poor, ransacked abandoned houses, and on
their way back still managed to commit highway
robbery and to steal purses. Thanks to
these scoundrels, many honest and pitiful people
were involved in the suspicion which wanderers
often arouse. Fortunately our people in Morny
are trustful enough, and they did their best to
assist the helpless and relieve the hungry. Even
in the poorest houses the peasants deemed it a
point of honour to share their food and lodging
with the wanderers. Several nights running, we
gave hospitality to unfortunate families, first to
Belgians and then to people of the North, small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
manufacturers of the neighbourhood of Fourmies.
All told the same heart-rending stories: the
order to evacuate, the house left ten minutes
after, the bewildered flight on the road. Many
had fled of their own free will, driven by the
breath of terror the Prussians spread abroad;
but all were way-worn, all talked of sleepless
nights, hunger, thirst, and suffering.</p>

<p>"Alas," said a young girl, "there are some
still unhappier than we are! Graves have been
dug by the wayside; one woman has lost her
mother, another her baby."</p>

<p>And under their breath they whispered the
nameless deeds, the monstrous crimes committed
by the Germans.</p>

<p>Their stories left us half incredulous, and if
terror seized upon our soul, it was a far-off,
unselfish terror. It did not occur to our minds
that the tempest was lowering overhead; we
refused to believe that the dyke over there had
already given way, and that we ourselves might
be overrun by the tumultuous flood of invasion.
And then, on Wednesday, August 26, three
Belgian officers announced that 12,000 Belgian
soldiers, "the remainder of an army forty
thousand strong," would march through the
village the next day at five.</p>

<p>The excited people gathered in knots on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
road long before the appointed time, and having
nothing else to do let their tongues run on.
Much news was exchanged, some of which seemed
insipid, and some thrilling.</p>

<p>The <i>Journal de Laon</i>, born with the war,
ceased to come out owing "to postal difficulties."
This organ surely suffered from a secret blemish:
it was not born to live. Indifference.</p>

<p>No trains came from the North. Indeed!
And we had been told everything would go on
miraculously well, as soon as the mobilisation
was over. Astonishment.</p>

<p>The people of the "Terres Rouges"&mdash;a remote
quarter of Morny&mdash;persuaded that the Prussians
were approaching, made a great slaughter of
their plumpest pigs and poultry, and devoured
them hastily. "It is so much gained," they
wisely thought. What a droll idea! Hilarity.</p>

<p>But ... and this seemed odd. The ladies
of the Red Cross, leaving the wounded in the
lurch, scampered away last night. Shame upon
them! Surely the strait-laced nurses would
never be guilty of indiscretion, and yet they
commit strange blunders. Reprobation.</p>

<p>The staff is established in Laon. Ah! Ah!
That is worthy of note. It will be interesting
to see the town in its new aspect of headquarters.
Interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>And here are the newspapers a neighbour has
brought straight from Paris! Change of Ministry.
Formation of a Ministry of National Defence.
Oh! Oh! This is somewhat curious. They are
hiding things from us. Anxiety.</p>

<p>While the village was busy in discussion, time
went on, and the Belgian army also. About
seven, the boys that stood sentry over the road
came on shouting:</p>

<p>"Here they are! Here they are!"</p>

<p>They were coming indeed, white with dust,
but still gallant-looking. First came lancers,
then gunners, a few foot-soldiers, and again
lancers. Here and there a spiked helmet topped
a lance's point as a trophy, and the gunners,
along with their guns, dragged a canteen carried
off from the enemy. For three hours they went
at a gallop, and for three hours we shouted our
throats sore, and the whole village with us:</p>

<p>"Bravo! Long life to Belgium! Success to
the brave!"</p>

<p>The soldiers, still galloping, answered at the
top of their voice:</p>

<p>"<i>Vive</i> France! Down with Germany! Hurrah
for the French women!"</p>

<p>And, rushing forward, we shook all the hands
that were stretched towards us. That night I
think we shook 12,000 hands as 12,000 men went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
along. We ran, we were everywhere. Colette
was madly imprudent, and I wondered at her
not being run over or crushed under the wheels
of the cannons. At last, about half-past ten,
the village was silent, as we made our way home
with hoarse voices and tired arms, thinking only
of our beds. There will be time enough for
serious politics to-morrow.</p>

<p>The next day we went to Laon, Geneviève
and I. If we were uneasy and disquieted, where
could we better calm our fears than in Laon?
The official reports were vague but rather encouraging,
the officers optimistic. The civilians
thought there was no room for hesitation, and
unhesitatingly ran away. Many were already
off. The cowards were frightened, like hares, by
the shadow of their ears. Our scorn was greater
even than their haste. We reserved our sympathies
for the soldiers whose bright uniforms
gave a pleasant liveliness to the town. We were
less pleased with the checks put upon our movements.
Passports had to be produced at every
corner of the streets, and then, after two hours
waiting among a noisy and ill-smelling crowd,
to be signed in a guardroom. This was&mdash;if
necessary and comprehensible&mdash;very tiresome.</p>

<p>All the same we felt uneasy on our way home.
We were infringing the regulations, that was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
clear as day. "It is strictly forbidden to take
any provisions out of the town," the orders said.
But there is no use talking of obedience to hungry
women, and we had&mdash;with what pains&mdash;carried
off from a greedy grocer rice, sugar, salt, and
other precious things, that ran short in the
country. Fortunately we saw the Mayor of
Morny driving by, and from him we gratefully
accepted a lift for the sake of our parcels.</p>

<p>The evening was lovely, the country smiling
in the setting sun. The harvest, somewhat
delayed for want of men and horses, drew to its
close, and beetroot promised a splendid crop.
Everything spoke of peace and plenty. The
Mayor with a word broke the spell. "From this
place," he said, pointing at a hill disgraced by
the presence of a factory, "the cannon was
audible yesterday."</p>

<p>"It is mere hearsay," he added, daunted by
our protestations, and we all came to the conclusion
the hearers had but singing in their
ears.</p>

<p>Thus at the side of the Mayor we made a
sensational entrance into Morny.</p>

<p>At home they had taken in two Belgian
soldiers, whose lucky star had led to our door.
In great haste the family had prepared a huge
omelette, a solid beefsteak, a comfortable salad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Then to pay their share they had talked. Alas,
what they said was not encouraging:</p>

<p>"We have been beaten; the Germans are
gaining ground." They knew nothing more. The
next day we had another Belgian to feed. Our
ward, Pierrot, met him in the street in quest of
a dinner, and, showing him the way, had brought
the soldier into the dining-room. Our new guest
told us frightful stories, and talked of defeat
and high treason; but, on the other hand, he
boasted of such high deeds he had performed
himself that we listened wholly unmoved to
his wondrous tales.</p>

<p>Defeat! Treason! We had no fear on that
score. In spite of a vague alarm, we apprehended
no real danger. Some uneasiness stole
first over our minds when we got a telegram from
Mme. Prat claiming Pierrot back. It was the
30th of August. We ran to the station, and were
there told with the greatest serenity:</p>

<p>"There is no train going to Laon to-night."</p>

<p>"To-morrow will do, then; there is no hurry."</p>

<p>We thought no more of the journey, for the
majors' dinner took place that very evening.
All that wore a uniform were sure to arouse an
admiring interest. The soldiers were overwhelmed
with love and adulation. A little more, and we
would have prostrated ourselves at their feet. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was but right. What sacrifices could we make to
match what they gave us: their strength, their
life, their youth? And they were France herself;
they were ourselves. Every woman who
spoiled a trooper said to herself: "My son too is
a soldier."</p>

<p>On this Sunday, then, the village was overjoyed
to hear that soldiers would be billeted
on it.</p>

<p>"A good thing. We shall see some officers,
and perhaps hear some news." And we kept
our eyes open, ready to snap up the first piece of
gold lace that would come on. The said lace
happened to be on the sleeve of a surgeon-major,
who to our anxious questions gave us an evasive
answer, and seized time by the forelock.</p>

<p>"Oh, madam," he said to my mother-in-law,
"shall I dare ask you...."</p>

<p>"Dare ask it, sir."</p>

<p>"To lend us your kitchen and your dining-room?
We are ten surgeon-majors, and we have
nowhere to dine."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my house is at your disposal."</p>

<p>"But say nothing about it! It is not here
that our quarters are."</p>

<p>His companion, a giddy-brained youth fresh
from the schools, who hitherto had not opened
his mouth, cried out:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will say that the ladies are relations of
ours. Mademoiselle will not refuse to declare
I am her cousin."</p>

<p>The haughty Antoinette did not like the joke,
and snubbed the joker. Then Esculapius' disciples
went away, to return speedily. We exchanged
a great many low bows, and, the ceremony
performed, left the gentlemen for fear we should
disturb them. They seemed to want rest, judging
from their worn-out faces. We heard that one
of our guests who had just fallen into a doze was
the famous Professor X, and we beheld his tired
face with some respect. In a clandestine meeting
we had decided:</p>

<p>"We shall have supper in the garden."</p>

<p>"We will drink a cup of milk, and eat bread
and butter."</p>

<p>We are not of those who believe in the necessity
of dining. Of course, out of respect for our
stomachs, we give them tolerable cheer, but occasionally
we are content with a cup of cocoa and
a slice of bread. And that night we had other
fish to fry than to feed ourselves. Besides, we
were unlucky enough to have no maids at all at
that time; the only one we had left had refused
to stay any longer in a place likely to be invaded.</p>

<p>Our modest meal over, we ran into the house.
In the kitchen, the dinner was getting on well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
A savoury smell rose from the saucepans. A giant
scullion was helping a cook, who pontified solemnly.
This strange cook hid beneath his apron, assumed
for the occasion, a uniform covered all over with
decorations. Beneath the trade of cook, also
assumed for the occasion, he hid that of an
engineer in civil life, in military life that of an
hospital orderly. He was tall, spare, pale, red-haired,
and he looked unalterably calm.</p>

<p>"Where are the Germans?" we asked the
engineer-cook. "Will they come here? What
ought we to do?"</p>

<p>He feared the Prussians would reach Morny,
and in his opinion we had better avoid the
meeting.</p>

<p>"Are we to run away, then, and wander about
like the Belgians? Or shall we take a ticket to
Marseilles, Algiers, or Timbuktu? Is that far
enough?"</p>

<p>Our interlocutor stilled our impatience with
the slow sounds of his voice. Really now, he had
a castle ... in the air?... No, but in Brittany,
where his sister would be delighted to receive
us.... And the head cook, while draining dry
his fried potatoes, gave us the address of his
mansion in Brittany. After the advice of the
kitchen, we wanted the counsels of the dining-room.
A few sleepy-heads had already gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bed, among others the celebrated physician and
the giddy-brained youth, who had grown extremely
serious. The remainder of the learned
party were chatting together amid the smoke of
tobacco and the flowers on the table. Without
more ado we went in, and asked the usual
questions:</p>

<p>"Where are the Germans? Will they come
here? What ought we to do?"</p>

<p>A long conversation ensued. Alas, our guests
were as pessimistic as could be. The head major,
a small man, thick-set, energetic, and dark, did
not hide from us the truth that we should see the
Germans, and, still worse, that they would lay
siege to Paris. Grief and indignation prevented
us from looking at our own situation; we thought
but of the country itself.</p>

<p>"Why," Geneviève cried out, "you think
the Germans will conquer us! You are expecting
another '70?"</p>

<p>"Never! never! The Germans will be beaten.
Should they go to Marseilles and Bordeaux, I
should still believe in their final defeat, but the
moment is a critical one. We have been beaten;
it is a certain fact; there is no use being blind
to it, and the Germans will go to Paris."</p>

<p>A clear voice rose at the end of the table:</p>

<p>"You talk as if we were lost," Colette said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"We are retreating? It may be a wise measure.
Our men are ready for anything. The Germans
in Paris!&mdash;but you do not know our soldiers!"</p>

<p>"Very good," said the neighbour of Colette,
a tall, fair-haired man. "Do try to convince my
friends; these ten days I have dinned the same
arguments into their ears. But you must excuse
our despondency; weariness is the cause of it;
these last three weeks we have hardly slept. And
what do we see of war? Nothing that is not
horrible and disheartening&mdash;battle-fields after
the fight, the dead, the wounded, the stragglers&mdash;nothing
that elevates, and idealises men."</p>

<p>So the talk went on, and the dining-room rang
with the praises the doctors bestowed on their
heroic patients. They spoke chiefly of the terrible
weariness of the men.</p>

<p>"They are overcome with sleep," they said,
"and to such an extent that they don't wake up,
even when we dress their wounds."</p>

<p>A few minutes after, Colette said to her neighbour:</p>

<p>"It is delightful to discuss with you. At least,
you always agree with me!"</p>

<p>We all burst out laughing, and at this fit of
gaiety the majors went softly out for fear they
would wake up the officers and the refugees whom
we were sheltering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>Sleep was long in coming that night. After
much talking we were still at a loss what to
think. Were the Germans really at our gates?
"I cannot believe it," groaned Geneviève; "it
is a collapse; it is the end of all things."</p>

<p>"If we are invaded, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>The next day we renewed the discussion.</p>

<p>"If the Prussians come, we have but to wait
for them with a bold face," said Geneviève and
Colette. Mme. Valaine hesitated.</p>

<p>"Mother," exclaimed Yvonne and Antoinette,
"we cannot stay here. Think of the risks we
run."</p>

<p>"What shame," retorted Colette, "to run
away like a troop of rabbits! I had never
thought you were such cowards!"</p>

<p>The others repeated with one accord:</p>

<p>"And if mother was taken as a hostage? The
Germans are capable of anything; they have
already committed many atrocities."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Our perplexity was great.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock there dropped from the sky
three new surgeons, and, pressing on them a cup
of coffee, we renewed our anxious questions.
They told us plainly that the Germans were
gaining ground, and that we were sure to see them.</p>

<p>"What do you advise us to do?" cried my
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Madam," Dr. Seseman declared&mdash;he was
bearded, jovial, and fatherly&mdash;"Madam, if you
were relations of mine, I should urge your departure."</p>

<p>"Well, the die is cast, we shall go," declared
Mme. Valaine.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "but the house is not in order."</p>

<p>A few days ago, as I went to Mme. Lantois to
buy some eggs, the farmer's wife told me with
great satisfaction:</p>

<p>"I feel quieter now, my house is in order."</p>

<p>It was as much as to say that all she set store
by had disappeared; the family had hidden,
buried, and walled up whatever they had been
able to hide, bury, and wall up.</p>

<p>Our guests of yesterday's dinner had told us
that the owners of a northern farm had unpaved
a yard, dug a huge hole, huddled in pieces of
furniture and pictures, and then filled up and
repaved it. This farm could await the invaders:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it was in order. But our house was not in order&mdash;that
was obvious enough.</p>

<p>"You have here," said our visitors, "a beautiful
Empire clock. It would be a great pity to
have it sent to Germany."</p>

<p>"And this lovely console table&mdash;and those
vases...."</p>

<p>A few minutes after the two officers, with
whom we were gravely discussing, asked:</p>

<p>"Where is our friend Laison?"</p>

<p>"In the garden with Colette, digging holes...."</p>

<p>"Is he? then we will too."</p>

<p>And soon after, our visitors, in their shirt-sleeves,
seemed to strive who would dig hardest;
and we, just as busy, ran in all directions, and
brought in objects of every kind.</p>

<p>In order to carry out our plan, we had to look
for a favourable place. In front of the house
stretches a velvet lawn planted here and there
with firs and pretty reeds. We could do nothing
there. But beyond there are beds in the gardens,
shaped like a lozenge, a crescent, and what not,
box-edged and planted with shrubs. That was
the right place, and we proved it by digging
there six or seven big holes. The largest received
the drawing-room clock, carefully wrapped up in
oilcloth, with other clocks almost as dearly
cherished. On this side, we buried silver, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that, old china, with a great deal of bustle and
haste.</p>

<p>"Is the old Rouen jug buried? And my
yellow tea-set? I will bury that too; it is too
lovely to lose."</p>

<p>The work drew to an end, and, by a masterpiece
of cunning, we strewed the newly-dug
ground with dry leaves, twigs, and small pebbles.</p>

<p>Dr. Laison went into ecstasies about the
garden he had made over the grave of the clocks.
He was thinking himself a match for Le Nôtre,
when he gave a start. "What is that?" The
buried treasures, indignant at their ill-usage,
protested against it by the voice of the Empire
clock, which began to strike the hour. As we
listened to the silvery yet hollow sound which
came from the earth, we were reminded of a tale
by Edgar Poe. But we had to apply our thoughts
to other cares, and hide the linen and clothes.
After our guests were gone&mdash;loaded with grateful
blessings&mdash;we hardly spared the time to swallow
a hasty dinner, and went to give the finishing
touch to our work.</p>

<p>Now there is between the ceiling of my bedroom
and the roof a very dark and lofty space that
might serve as a very good hiding-place; but the
ladder was too short to get to it, so we put it on
a table, and I, astride on a beam, concealed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
accommodating shadow the things which my
sisters-in-law, posted on the ladder like so many
tilers busy with new roofing, handed up to me.
We spread out and heaped up, at first linen, then
clothes, furs, shawls, carpets, curtains, eider-down
coverlets, and a big lion-skin; with many
exertions we even hoisted up to the loft a console
table. Colette, standing on tiptoe at the other
end of the attic, declared:</p>

<p>"It looks quite empty; you can put in more
things."</p>

<p>"Thanks! We are quite stiff enough for once.
Thank Heaven the Germans don't come every
day, or we should not be equal to the job."</p>

<p>Downstairs we took down looking-glasses and
pictures, and concealed them as well as we could
behind cupboards and bed-curtains. They showed
a little, but we hoped the Germans would see
nothing of them. We could not bury water-colours
or oil-paintings, could we?</p>

<p>At last the house was in order, and we went
out for a little stroll. The village was silent,
dead, not a cat in the streets; all the doors and
windows were closed. It was evident that every
one was giving himself wholly up to the very sport
we had just enjoyed. All were vying with one
another in hiding their treasures, and were
racking their brains to find unknown holes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
undiscoverable hiding-places. I wish to state
here that there is a gap in our public instruction,
a want in our literature. Since we are provided
with such alarming neighbours, every school-master
should devote two hours a week to teach
our youth what precautions to take in case of
invasion. Moreover, in my leisure hours, I intend
to write a book on "The Art of Concealing
applied to Invasion." This may open a new field
of literature, for they will certainly lose no time
in answering the work from the other side of the
Rhine with "The Treasure-seeker's Guide, or a
Hand-book for the Complete Plunderer." We
shall have, therefore, to study the question and
improve the art of hiding. In this respect, it is
true, an ancient instinct may serve as a guide, an
instinct which has had no better chance of expansion
than in the corner of France we belong to.
This rich country has excited the lust of all
conquerors. Before the Christian era the Romans
subdued it, and later on the Franks laid hands
upon it. Attila, as Colette said but yesterday,
may have sent a few patrols down here. Then
came the Normans, who levied contributions on
us; and the English, who took their ease at the
inhabitants' cost during the Hundred Years' War.
Later the troops of Philip the Second plundered
us, and last century, 1814, 1870&mdash;two inauspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dates&mdash;we knew the strangers twice more. Therefore,
when the alarm spread, "the enemy are advancing,"
the order of the day, which we knew by
right of inheritance, went round: "let us hide,
let us hide!" All kept on hiding, and we hid too.</p>

<p>And our departure? We had decided to go,
that was well and good; but how should we go?
We could not by railway, and we could not find
a horse and a carriage in the village for their
weight in gold. Mme. Valaine went in haste
to M. Laserbe, who was setting out with three
carts drawn by oxen. He promised to take us
and our luggage with him, as little luggage as
possible.</p>

<p>"Never fear, I will tell you in good time.
There is no danger for the present."</p>

<p>These words gave us confidence. We would
fly, but whither, in this train of sluggard things?
I have mentioned the ridges that lie to the south
and the west of Morny. In the country these
modest hills are pompously called "the mountains."
Now every one was convinced the
Germans would shun "the mountains." An
army always goes along valleys, does it not?
And what would the enemy do in this uneven
region, where orchards and pasture grounds
alternate with rocks and woods? "It is not the
right place to fight in," the people said. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a hamlet in this happy part of the country lives
an old relation of ours, Mme. Laroye. We
decided to go to Cousin Laroye; we were sure she
would receive us with open arms; there we
should see what to do next, and, when once the
enemy had passed over both sides of "the mountains,"
we could get to Switzerland, the South
of France, or Brittany as we chose.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after this busy day, we really
wanted rest, and to-night at least we would
sleep our fill. But we do not shape our own
ends.... At half-past two we were up. Foot
soldiers passed in the street. At three we were
standing at the window, busy pouring out wine
or coffee. Our poor, poor soldiers! So cheerful,
so lively, so full of gay spirits but a month ago,
in what a state did we see them return!</p>

<p>Bent, way-worn, they marched painfully.
Yet they marched; but as soon as they were
ordered to stop, they dropped on the ground, and
many fell asleep on the spot. Still, when they
heard we were giving something to drink, they
came tumbling one over another, and gathered
around the window. A captain advanced, quieted
the disturbance, and ordered the sergeants to
distribute the bottles of wine by sections. At
the sight of this officer, I suddenly understood the
gravity of the hour. Dark-haired, with firm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
yet fine features, he bore in his eyes the bitterness
of the retreat, the horror of the defeat. A look
on his tragic face informed me of the truth better
than long speeches. Beaten! We were beaten.
France was lost....</p>

<p>O God! is it possible? Has God suffered
this? No, no, it is not so; I see now the flames,
that protest in the feverish eyes: "We will die,
but we will struggle to the end." Yes, dear
soldiers, brave heroes, you will struggle against
the enemy, happy that you can still take an
active part, while we, we can but wring our hands
in despair, and support your courage with love
and earnest prayers. In this terrible moment, our
eager goodwill could do no more than ask: "Do
you want a cup of coffee? The water is boiling."</p>

<p>"Madam, with pleasure." Then some one
called the officer, and he had to go without
his coffee, for which, by the way, many were
eager.</p>

<p>The village was awake, and all were desirous
to bring food and drink to the soldiers. But the
soldiers were so many that a great number
certainly got nothing at all.</p>

<p>Day broke, and the men still passed on,
always as dusty, always as tired, all regiments,
all arms mixed in confusion. We did our best to
relieve as many as we could. In the morning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
crowd grew thinner; we saw only stragglers and
cripples. How many we took in to comfort and
nurse I cannot say; they were too many. I
remember the clerk of the telegraph pointing
to his right hand, of which the fingers had been
shot off.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now?" he said. "And
the girl I am engaged to, will she marry
me?"</p>

<p>"Of course she will, or she would not be
French!"</p>

<p>And then came a soldier wounded in the leg,
and, in spite of his sufferings, he hobbled on with
a stick. In admiration, he indicated Antoinette
with a movement of his chin, and declared in his
Lorraine brogue:</p>

<p>"That girl there, she has dressed my wound
much better than a trained nurse."</p>

<p>A little linesman moved our pity still more,
and even now we cannot talk of him without
emotion. He was very young, with a childish
face; his motionless features expressed an
immense stupor, a grievous surprise. What!
that war! That was war! This wonderful
thing we had so often heard of! It was this
retreat, these toils, these sufferings! For three
weeks he had not taken off his shoes, and his
blistered feet were so swollen that the poor fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
could hardly walk. Geneviève washed his poor
feet, and Colette, the over-fastidious Colette,
wiped and bound them up with tender care. We
got him fresh socks, and the little foot soldier,
after a comfortable breakfast, went on his way
again. As he left us, he looked around him with
amazement depicted on his face, and said:</p>

<p>"The Germans will punish you for that."</p>

<p>In these busy hours we had many opportunities
to wonder at the energy and vitality of our race.
As soon as the soldiers, spent with fatigue and
disheartened, had rested a bit and swallowed
something hot, they renewed their vigour and
even recovered gaiety enough to tell us their
adventures, to laugh at the German shells, which
often do not burst, and whose fragments run over
the cloth of their uniforms, they assured us,
without doing any harm.</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;and there they dropped their voices to
a whisper&mdash;"we have been beaten, because there
are traitors among the generals...." This
opinion drove us to despair. We did not give
credit to it, but what would happen if the men
reposed no trust in their chiefs? And what
could we answer to the poor fellows? I recalled
to Geneviève's memory Captain Vinchamps'
saying: "Beaten soldiers always call out treason,
and they are not wrong; a traitor is not merely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
man who basely and selfishly sells his country;
he is a traitor too when he is not equal to his
duty."</p>

<p>We did our utmost to hearten our guests of a
moment, to cheer them physically and morally;
and then one after another they resumed their
journey. A touching detail: every lame soldier
was attended by a comrade, who took charge of
him, carried his knapsack, held him up, and was
as careful of him as a mother of her child. About
noon, when all had gone away, Yvonne and
Colette, who kept a watchful eye upon the street,
cried out: "Something is happening towards
the pond," and set off running thither. They
found that a soldier had suddenly gone mad.
Half-naked, up to his waist in water, he shrieked
and gesticulated, and four men had a hard
struggle to master him.</p>

<p>Trifling as it was, this incident brought the
people's excitement to its highest point.</p>

<p>"He is a Prussian," said one. "He is a spy,"
retorted another. This time the people snatched
at their luggage, were off in an instant, and came
back an hour after. The level-crossings were
not open to civilians for the present, or at least
to carriages. Our state of mind was that of a
fish caught in a net. Terror spread amain, and
won complete power over the public mind. None<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
knew what he dreaded, and all men reasoned
themselves out of reason. Our arguments were
proved absurd and grotesque by the event. A
mist was over us; it was no more the pillar of
fire; it was the pillar of cloud. It was no more
the shadow of approaching glory; it was the
black shadow which impending invasion casts
before.</p>

<p>News kept coming.</p>

<p>"The Prussians are at Marle."</p>

<p>"No, they have been driven back."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they won't come down here."</p>

<p>Driven back! Oh, you simpletons! Have
you not just seen our army pass? Are you not
conscious of the void, which draws on the enemy
like a cupping-glass?</p>

<p>In the village, so lively, so busy but a few days
ago, is there a single uniform left?</p>

<p>At heart the people felt uneasy; the cars were
loaded, the horses harnessed, the drivers on the
look-out. Animals and people were but waiting
for a signal to rush upon an unknown fate.</p>

<p>The signal came.</p>

<p>It was about six. Tired, I was lying down in
the drawing-room, when all of a sudden a gun-shot
resounded in the air, and directly after followed
sharp firing. At a bound I was up in the attic,
at another I flew to the garret window. Like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
gargoyle stretched out on the edge of the roof,
I scanned the horizon. Northward a light puff
of smoke vanished in the upper branches of the
poplar trees. Nothing was to be heard; but
I beheld the confused flight of all creatures that
were out in the fields. A man standing in a car
lashed his bewildered horse with all his might;
fowls and even pigeons hurried away to poultry-yard
and dovecot.</p>

<p>What had happened? I hastened down.
The house was empty. I jumped out of the
window. At the corner of the street I caught
sight of Geneviève. I ran after her as fast as I
could; we met at the cross-road, where a crowd
had gathered.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" A patrol.... An
English patrol.</p>

<p>We cast a look at the field-grey backs which
rode away on big horses. English? it may be!</p>

<p>"But at what did they fire?"</p>

<p>"It was a signal."</p>

<p>"No, they have shot carrier-pigeons."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, they have arrested a spy."</p>

<p>In fact they had taken away a French soldier,
bareheaded, who looked about him with a profoundly
ironical air.</p>

<p>"Oh," murmured the crowd, "it was easy to
see he was a spy; he seemed to laugh at us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>He was laughing at you! I am sure he was,
the poor man! English soldiers! English
soldiers! Oh, you blind of one, of two eyes,
threefold idiots, how foolish you have been!
They were twelve in number, and the village was
armed, and the men were there, and Prussians in
flesh and bone, as quiet as can be, took the high
road to Laon!</p>

<p>We, quiet too, came back home. There now!
We had had our warning! Our hearts were still
throbbing violently, but all the same we plucked
up courage again.</p>

<p>"The English keep watch and ward!"</p>

<p>Each one laughed at his friends' fright. We
thought particularly ridiculous the attitude of
one of our neighbours, Marthe Tournillart, a tall
young woman, ruddy-cheeked and dark-haired,
who at the first shot had rushed headlong on her
overloaded barrow. Resolutely she laid hold of
it, and with her two children hanging on to her
skirts, fled away bewildered but energetic, she
knew not where; but she fled straight into the
hottest of the fight, had one taken place.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the passage of the patrol was
looked upon as suspicious. "We put no trust in
this lump of flour," the peasants thought, like
La Fontaine's mice. "If we hear the guns now,
it is the right moment for flight."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Yvonne ran to M. Laserbe. When and how
were we to go? The messenger came back struck
with dismay. Laserbe refused to take charge of
us! The traitor! And he had pledged his word!
He alleged he had no places left. Well, what
were we to do? Whither could we turn? Could
we go on foot? To-night?</p>

<p>Mme. Valaine hesitated. She thought it
dangerous in this troubled time to run away by
night through woods and fields.</p>

<p>"We will see what to-morrow brings," she said.</p>

<p>"Mother, to-morrow may be too late," retorted
Antoinette.</p>

<p>"The first thing to do," said I, "is to have
supper. There is a soup on the table which will
give you wings."</p>

<p>It was about nine. Hazardous times do not
improve punctuality. We sat down to table,
and had hardly enjoyed a few mouthfuls of the
soup I had boasted of, when hasty steps resounded
in the street; we heard a knock at the shutter.
We rushed forward.</p>

<p>"The Prussians are coming," whispered one
of our neighbours. "They are ten miles away.
They have been seen on their way to Morny.
French officers have been to the Mayor's, and
have pulled down the flag. Every one is going.
Good-bye; we won't lose time...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>I am going, you are going, we are going. Go
on, oh flock of sheep!</p>

<p>Our own house is greatly alarmed. Mme.
Valaine does not know which way to turn. "Make
haste, we must go at once. Get our things
ready." Thinking Laserbe would take us, we
had packed up just what was necessary, and
what was necessary meant thirteen bags. We
must discard them. Feverishly we unpacked
and abandoned the heavy bags; bundles would
do. A little linen, one or two light dresses, cloaks,
shawls, a basket filled with food, and we were
quite ready. Had I not early in the morning
buried in the depths of the garden a sealed-up
glass jar full of jewels? And with the gold pieces
my mother-in-law had brought from Paris, had I
not made a band I wore around my waist? We
were ready, no doubt of it.</p>

<p>We did not know what to do with the bags
we were bound to abandon. We dragged them
upstairs to a loft next my bedroom, thrust them
into it all topsy-turvy, and hurriedly heaped up
big logs at the entrance. Everything was in
order; the dogs were on their chains; we had
but to go.</p>

<p>Here we are in the street, all doors shut, and
off we go. We wait one minute to calm our
hearts and to drop a tear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Dear little house, white walls, virginia creepers,
when shall we meet again? And what will you
look like? Let us begone! It is time for action,
not for regret.</p>

<p>Our neighbours next door, the couple Tillard,
were putting the donkey in their cart all ready
for flight.</p>

<p>I have read somewhere that people should help
one another in misfortune, and so I blurted out:
"Oh, M. Tillard, I suppose you are driving to
'the mountains.' We are going too. Would
you kindly take one of our parcels with you?"
At a loss what to answer, Tillard muttered between
his teeth:</p>

<p>"Hum! already loaded.... Don't know
which way...."</p>

<p>That is enough. "Thank you.... I understand."
Another pause, this time at M. Lonet's,
my mother-in-law's brother. Stern-faced, with
knotted brows, our uncle refuses to go. Not he!
He is fonder of his house, of his gardens, than of
anything, and the Germans cannot scare him
away. He bends on our caravan a glance of
mingled scorn and pity, and, on going out, Geneviève
whispered in my ear as a last protest:</p>

<p>"He is not a coward."</p>

<p>If fear could not enter M. Lonet's heart, it
reigned in the village. The whole place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
deserted, and we were among the last to go. Here
and there a flickering light showed that hasty
preparations were still being made in a few houses.
Terror oozed from the closed shutters, hostile to
the expected foe, and from the doors, which
presently the dwellers would half open, to sneak
away. At the end of the village, in a yard, a
lantern moved to and fro, a horse was harnessed,
people hurried up and down.</p>

<p>"Lucky rogues," Colette cried out, "who
possess a cart!"</p>

<p>That is true. Our bundles already seemed
heavy to bear. But, full of courage, we went on,
left the high road, crossed Cerny-les-Bucy, dead,
empty, mute. Another struggle and we were
in the open country. Thus we marched on&mdash;a
strange little train, six women, attended by a
small boy and two dogs&mdash;silent, with heavy
hearts, and then a voice complained:</p>

<p>"It is so heavy."</p>

<p>Yvonne had taken charge of the dogs, and
had perhaps the hardest work, for these animals,
as soon as they are out of doors, pull on
their chain, until they almost tear out your
fingers.</p>

<p>The road was deserted. Nobody in front of
us, nobody behind. We were safe from attack.
We decided to rest awhile. Halt! We gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
our luggage into the middle of the road, and sat
down in a ditch. Speechless, we looked at and
listened to the night.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the night of our flight, as
I watched it in that meadow. Silvery night
studded with stars, lit up by the moon, warm and
sweet and so quiet! Fields and meadows, bathed
in moonlight, stretched on all sides. Southward
a wood showed like a shadow, and from the damp
meadows rose a mist, which followed the brook.
You might have said that large puffs of cotton
wool hung in the air upon invisible threads, above
which emerged the tops of pollarded willows.
Not a sound was heard. Only far away a carriage
rattled, or a dog barked; and close about us
the crickets sang their shrill song. A god-like
presence filled the world, and the serenity of
inanimate things contrasted sharply with the
mad fear of men which swept us away. On this
same night, uniformly kind to all, whole armies
marched, dreaming of death and destruction,
while thousands of wayworn fugitives wandered
on towards uncertainty, misery, despair.</p>

<p>Boom, boom! Two formidable detonations
from the fort of Laniscourt shook the air, and
aroused us from the torpor which crept over us.
Was it a signal? We did not know. We went
on. Go, take up your burden again, hasten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the way is long. We went on, but slowly; we
were tired, and baggage always retards the
advance of an army. Poor snails that we were!
The flood was approaching; it had driven us
away; and if in our unreasoning prudence we
resembled snails, we had not the good luck
to carry a house with us. What shelter should
we get? Where should we lay our tired heads?
We advanced anyhow, our ears pricked, our eyes
on the look-out. An alarm! This shadow on
the road, which moves on...! black, apocalyptical,
it passed by, and greeted us without
astonishment:</p>

<p>"Good-night, ladies; a beautiful night, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>We recognised old Lolé, a well-known beggar,
bent with age, loaded with a wallet full to the
brim. Another shadow, a white one this time,
crossed our path a few steps farther on; it was
a small dog, which did not stop, but hurried on
his way to Morny. The times were hard for
dogs too.</p>

<p>"And then, look behind that stack&mdash;two,
three, five dark forms ... they are people,
aren't they?" But, still more afraid than we,
they hid themselves, and we passed on triumphantly.
Without striking a blow, we crossed the
woods, and got to the fields again. On approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Mons-en-Laonnois we heard eleven strike.
The silvery sound of the bell seemed to drop
from a very high tower, from the starry sky,
perhaps. Here we made a feeble and vain
attempt to get a carriage. No one in the streets;
the very garret windows were shut up, the doors
barricaded. At the end of the village, we halted.
We were hungry, for the good reason that we had
left on the supper-table the creamy milk and
crusty cake, which were to end our frugal meal.
But we had taken with us a few savoury chicken
<i>pâtés</i>, which my prudent mother-in-law had made
the day before. We cut slices of bread and
butter, and, sitting by the wayside, made an
excellent meal. We were gay, but our gaiety
was fictitious. We laughed at a light anxiously
flickering behind a shutter. It seemed a prey
to nameless terror, and, conscious of our own
courage, we made merry over it. The poor thing
surely believed a German patrol was feasting at
the gate!</p>

<p>Two hours after, we got to Vaucelles, then to
Royaucourt. We were tired to death, and made
up our minds to seek shelter. All the barns were
full of refugees, all the yards were encumbered
with refugees' horses, all the streets were crowded
with refugees' vehicles. We too were refugees
now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will there be any room for us," we wondered,
"no matter where, so long as we can rest?" We
stopped in front of Mlle. Honorine's inn: "Good
accommodation for man and beast." It was
just what we wanted. We gave a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, open the door,
please ... just a small room, only chairs to sit
down." But none so deaf as those who won't
hear. Nothing would have roused Mlle. Honorine
from her sweet slumbers.</p>

<p>At length we made up our minds to rest
outside, on the threshold of the unrelenting
house. An accommodating bench very kindly
welcomed three of us, Geneviève and Antoinette,
wrapped up in their cloaks, stretched on the
stony ground of the courtyard. As to myself,
I chose for a resting-place a flight of steps.
Crouching down in a comfortable corner, with
Pierrot nestled in my arms, I covered our bodies
with my shawl, and summoned sleep in vain.
The stone was very hard. Yet I was comfortable,
and had no mind to go away. But we soon
remembered we were running away, and that it
was high time for us to be off again. "Get up!
get up! It is half-past two." We rose reluctantly,
yawned, cleared our throats, stretched
ourselves. Antoinette was so weary and so ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that we had much trouble to move her. At
length we were all up. We cursed the household
that had behaved so unkindly to the poor
wanderers, and, leaving the inhospitable village,
we turned to the right. The road wound its way
through the woods. The moon had gone down;
it was pitch dark; our hearts quivered with fear;
our eyes searched into the shades of night; and
we strained our ears like the dogs. The poor
beasts disapproved of our nightly expedition, and
sniffed at tufts of grass with great anxiety.</p>

<p>"This black mass here, lying on the wayside,
is it a dead body? No, it is but a log. And
there, those white spots, aren't they faces?
No, they are birches. Don't you hear a noise
of steps? No, it is the breaking of a dead
branch." We stopped to take a little breath.
We were out of the forest; we had reached the
top of the hill. Quite bare, it was not really
a plateau, for the ground spread itself out
in large waves. We walked along, dragging our
luggage up and down the road. Geneviève and
I carried the heaviest bag, and tried many
experiments to make it lighter. We put it on
our shoulders like an urn, on our back like a
sack of flour. Like the queen of the turtles, we
hung it on a stick, of which each of us took an
end. From time to time we stopped a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to change hands, or to listen to far-away noises.
Then a slight quivering broke the stillness. We
thought we heard a distant rumbling. Sometimes
there were explosions&mdash;bridges were being
blown up. Day was already breaking. A pallor
whitened the sky towards the east. We reached
Urcel, prettily placed among orchards on the
slope of a hill. Worn out, we sat on the edge of
the pavement like so many swallows on the edge
of a gutter. We were in high spirits, we exchanged
jokes, and all of a sudden:</p>

<p>"Yvonne, Yvonne, laughter will end in
crying...."</p>

<p>Indeed, the poor girl, still half-choked with
laughter, was now sobbing bitterly. We gathered
round her, and tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Get up, get up, the inn will be open in a
minute, and we shall have a cup of coffee. Come."</p>

<p>At the first glimmering of the dawn, the shop
opened a shutter like a fearful eyelid.</p>

<p>We went in. The landlady, in a dressing-gown,
with her black hair loose over her shoulders,
dragged herself along, and raised her weeping
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heavens! they are coming here, aren't
they? What an unhappy, poor creature I am!
What will become of me? And my daughter,
aged fourteen years? What will become of us?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman's despair amused us, and we tried
to comfort her.</p>

<p>"The Prussians will never reach this out-of-the-way
place. Perhaps a patrol or two will come,
and that is all. All the world is seeking refuge
in 'the mountains.' Everybody knows the
Prussians won't come here."</p>

<p>On leaving Urcel, we plunged into the misty
shadows of a valley. But when we got on the
other side it was glorious, dazzling. The sun was
just rising, and beneath its first beams the country
smiled and glistened. The meadows, bathed in
dew, sparkled as though decked with gems; the
air was mild, nature thrilled with joy, a lark
carolled to the sun. Pierrot, drunk with light
and space, danced about like a little faun, and we
ourselves, for an insect, for a flower, for a bush
covered with bright berries, leapt like goats.
Our thoughts were lighter than the soft mists
melting in the sun.</p>

<p>War! It is but a myth.</p>

<p>Invasion! an idle tale.</p>

<p>Danger! an illusion.</p>

<p>Weariness, pangs, mental sufferings, all were
forgotten. We were young, we were strong; we
breathed the fresh air with ecstasy, and the
splendour of the hour intensified our love of life.
Danger is life. War is victory, and blessed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the hand which bestows on mankind black nights
and white mornings, dull cares and consoling joys.</p>

<p>With light hearts we took to our cheerful road.
We marched for one hour, and then doubts arose.</p>

<p>"Mother, you have taken the wrong road, I
am sure. Chevregny is not so far...."</p>

<p>Yet at a turn of the road we caught sight
of Chevregny, nestled in verdure, crouched in a
hollow way. We marvelled at the pointed steeple,
at the red tiles or blue slates of the roofs. So we
prepared to make an entrance into the village
worthy of us and it. We sat by the wayside and
took small looking-glasses and powder-puffs out
of our leather bags. Powder is as necessary to
women as to soldiers, isn't it? We did our hair,
brushed our dresses, and then went down the
village street quite smart. We turned to the
right and entered the big farm of Mme. Laroye.
Surprise, exclamations! Arms lifted up to the
sky, and then clasped around us in a close embrace!
Boundless friendship and endless hospitality
were promised us.</p>

<p>"But tell us, dear cousin, who are all these
people we see gathered in your domain?"</p>

<p>Mme. Laroye had already given hospitality to
twenty-one refugees in her barns and cart-sheds,
and had received into the bargain certain solid
citizens of Laon, persons whom she honoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with her friendship and best rooms. We did not
allow them to move from their quarters.</p>

<p>"If mother is provided for, dear cousin, it is
all that we want. Don't bother about us; we
will sleep in the hay-loft; it will be delightful."</p>

<p>When these matters were settled, we refreshed
ourselves. How delightful it was after that painful
night to take a bath, to loll in an armchair,
to sit at table where fresh bread, golden butter,
and transparent jam smiled upon us. We found
a charm in the smallest pleasures, and thought:</p>

<p>"Now we are quiet, now we are in safety, we
shall suffer nothing at the hands of the abhorred
invader; we shall not see the shadow of their
helmets on our walls; we shall not hear the
tramping of their horses on our pavements; the
booming of their cannon will not roll over our
hearts!"</p>

<p>But what did we hear?</p>

<p>We stood up, speechless with horror.</p>

<p>The street rang with loud cries, and those
cries were:</p>

<p>"The Prussians! The Prussians!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Placid and heavy on their placid, heavy horses,
they slowly advanced along the street. Of giant
stature, they came on, revolver in hand, with the
self-reliance of brutal strength. Their red-edged
caps made their hard-featured faces still harder.
It was a sight to strike Nature herself with horror,
and, hidden behind the muslin curtains, we sobbed
bitterly. The guests, huddled together in the
dimly lighted room. Were silently weeping; the
women crossed themselves, and watched over
their children as if it were old Bogy's steps they
heard. The men tugged nervously at their
moustaches, and shook their fists in the empty
air. Our gestures made the poor people uneasy.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" the women groaned, "don't
show your face at the window!"</p>

<p>"Don't open the curtains!"</p>

<p>"Don't draw their attention to the house!"</p>

<p>"How frank they are," an old woman
whimpered. "How splendid to be frank like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that! As to myself, I could not be so." I
suppose she meant courageous, but courage
was not in question. We thought of nothing;
we felt nothing; we were only looking at the
men. We were glaring with all our eyes at a
sight that crushed our souls. Grief left a huge
void in our hearts. The enemy was there, and
it was all up with us! I think we had
suffered less if we had seen the Germans arrive
in a town. A town is always somewhat of
a courtesan. It gives a hearty welcome and
hospitality to every one; it is daily a prey to
strangers of ill repute. If invasion beats against
its walls, if a hostile army crosses its streets&mdash;one
human flood succeeding so many others&mdash;the
town scowls at the foe, and then loses all
memory of him. But there in a small village,
hidden in a fold of the French ground, in
a tiny hamlet which a hostile mind never chose
for a shelter, the presence of the invaders seems
to profane the very grass; and ever after the
poor little place will remain an unhallowed spot,
which bloodshed and years will not purify
again.</p>

<p>After the horsemen had passed, there rolled
along cannon and powder-carts, whose rumbling
set our teeth on edge.</p>

<p>"Grandmother, look there!" cried out Colette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>On a powder-cart, looking very unhappy, sat
the small dog we had met in the meadow.</p>

<p>So the Germans had traversed Morny; they
had followed close upon us.</p>

<p>At last there came an end to the procession.
The street was empty. No one uttered a word,
and we ran away to cry to our hearts' content.
House, yard, barns were all crowded with people.
I took refuge in the garden. Nature seemed
covered with an ashen veil, the very sun was
obscured. Had the radiant morning really begotten
this sad noon? Like a wounded animal
looking for a dark shelter, I fled to the orchard,
and crouching down in a corner close to the wall
I wept most bitterly, without knowing why.
Some one called me; I had to go back to life, or
rather a life, unknown, unsuspected, in which
all was changed. The Prussians were advancing
through France.</p>

<p>On arriving at the house I met only with
grief-stricken features and swollen eyes. We had
no mind to eat. Only a few refugees, already
indifferent, and the dogs did not lose their
appetite. But standing at the dining-room
windows we saw a sight worth seeing. The
Prussians had taken possession of the village,
and were looking for what they might lay their
hands upon. They seemed to think little Mme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Laineux' shop had been created for their own
special use, and they set about plundering it
according to rule. They went up, three steps
at a time, got among the groceries, made their
choice, and came back, their arms filled with
bottles and bags. In short, they carried away all
that was eatable and drinkable in the house. They
went up and down without interruption like two
rows of ants busy stripping a sack of flour, one
row full, the other empty. The grocer's wife,
a small woman, dark and pale with large black
eyes, stood by, unable to withstand the plunderers.
She locked the door. The first soldier
who encountered that obstacle went to the
window, broke a square, turned the door-handle,
and muttering threats reopened the door.</p>

<p>With a look of despair, Mme. Laineux went and
fetched an officer who was eating upstairs.</p>

<p>"Come and see what your men are doing."</p>

<p>The officer came, looked round, and declared:</p>

<p>"C'est la kerre, Matame!"</p>

<p>And he went back to his lunch.</p>

<p>The shop cleared out, the men made farther
search into the house, and discovered a small
store-room, which they emptied with equal
activity. For the pleasure of the thing, they cut
stockings to transform them into socks, and
spilled ink on petticoats and blouses. The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
comers took the trap from the coach-house, the
horse out of his stable, put the horse in the trap,
and drove off with a light heart.</p>

<p>A bitter disenchantment filled our tired hearts.
Nothing would have astonished us. In the afternoon
two soldiers entered the farm, but at the
sight of the yard crowded with men and dogs,
withdrew. Broken down with weariness, we
went early to bed. A ladder about twenty feet
high led to a square opening through which we
climbed into the hay-loft. There every one of us
made a hole in the hay and buried herself in it.
Now, in theory, hay offers a soft and sweet-smelling
couch. The reality is slightly different.
You may find comfort in this bed if you are
wrapped up in cloaks and shawls to keep out the
cold of the night, but the odour of the hay will
make you sneeze, you will soon feel stiff in your
legs, and hard blades of grass will prick your
ankles and your neck.</p>

<p>Despite minor annoyances, my companions
were very soon slumbering. For my part I could
not sleep. I was feverish and ... my golden
waistband played tricks and got into my ribs.
The slanting light of the moon gave an added
pallor to the faces of the four sleeping girls,
whose presence on their bed of hay, beneath the
beams of the loft which spiders had covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
their grey lace, was astonishing enough. It
seemed as though the four heads had been put
there for a whim, and the bodies laid down somewhere
else. I fell into a doze. I saw hundreds
of Prussians pass before my eyes, laden with
goods, and carrying away the very houses.
Then there came a multitude of galloping horses,
which all vanished from my sight, and I was
asleep.</p>

<p>The next day an impudent sunbeam woke us
up by caressing our eyelids. In the barn below
the refugees were bustling about noisily. The
first moment after awaking was cruel; we had,
as Stendhal says, "to learn our misery afresh."
One after the other, like fowls getting out of the
henhouse, we went down our long ladder, and
ran off to wash and to hear the latest news.</p>

<p>That day also was a day of tears.</p>

<p>The villagers, frightened to death, had not
dared to unlock their doors, and we heard only
in the morning that a French convoy had been
taken by surprise and captured by the Germans
at Neuville, no more than two miles from
Chevregny.</p>

<p>Then a scout&mdash;a fact completely unconnected
with the former&mdash;had been killed by the enemy
at a cross-way, near Mme. Laroye's house. We
went to see the place, where the two white roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
cross each other; large reddish spots still marked
the ground. Kneeling down, we kissed this
blood which cried for revenge, and from our
inmost soul we besought Heaven that France
should be victorious over her enemy, so that her
heart's blood might not be shed in vain.</p>

<p>Some peasants, who had witnessed the scene,
gave us an account of it. In great numbers the
Germans came down the road. All of a sudden,
two French scouts appeared on the outskirts of the
wood, saw the enemy, fired at them, and then
turned back. One of them was lucky enough to get
under cover, but the other, severely wounded, was
unhorsed, and fell down. Stretched by the wayside
he made an attempt to get up, but his adversaries
rushed upon him, and in a confused scuffle beat
him to death with the butt-ends of their guns,
and rode away at full gallop.</p>

<p>The victim was to be buried that very morning,
and as we wished to be present at the
funeral, no time could be lost. When we arrived
at the churchyard two men were already digging
a narrow grave. The body, wrapped in a white
sheet, was lying on a stretcher. There was no
coffin. Soldiers should lie in the soil for which
they have died. The red spot beneath his head
grew larger little by little, and the blood that
trickled down made a dazzling rill in the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sand. We approached him with a shrinking
heart. With pious hands the grave-digger lifted
up the sheet to show us the face of the dead man.
An aquiline nose and a firm chin were still distinguishable.
The rest of the features were
clotted with blood and shapeless. Nearly choked
with sobs, we could not help wondering from which
wound the blood had flowed, when suddenly the
truth flashed upon us, at a gesture of the old
grave-digger, who pointed at what were, but the
day before, the boy's eyes. His eyes! oh, you
cowards! villains! They had not only beaten
him to death, they had put his eyes out! He was
defending himself like a brave soldier. He was
alone against twenty, and they had murdered
him. There on the white road, in the sunshine,
they had committed their crime; the shades of
night had fallen upon him before he descended
to the tomb.</p>

<p>Oh, vengeance! vengeance! We wept, we
cried, and nothing could comfort us. We wept
over the gallant soldier of France, who fell so
near us; we wept over all the dead and wounded,
and above all we wept&mdash;oh, narrowness of the
human heart!&mdash;over the one soldier we loved,
whose uncertain fate tortured our hearts. Oh, my
Posy, my treasure, my love, my pride, have you
not asked for a dangerous mission? Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
received your death-wound, outnumbered in some
lonely corner? Have they...? the terrifying
thought! ... oh, his eyes! ... his eyes!...
It was beyond endurance. Crushed with grief,
I fell senseless. When I came to myself the
priest had said the usual prayers, and was gone.
My companions stood up, shedding silent tears.
The two villagers gloomily filled the grave, and
the earth fell with a hollow sound on the poor
body. One of the men broke off in the middle
of his work, and told us of the scout's death.
What he said confirmed what we had already
heard. "Curse them!" he cried out, and, with
a gesture of rage, seized his spade, and began
again to fill the grave.</p>

<p>But we had not done with emotion yet.</p>

<p>"Do you know that the Germans took three
hundred prisoners yesterday?" some one asked
us. "You will see them pass on the road."</p>

<p>The churchyard is terraced to the street,
which runs down a steep hill, and thence already
we caught sight of a few horsemen, closely followed
by soldiers on foot. They were French.
At the sight of the enemy, our grief, all of a
sudden, turned to wrath and madness. Here
they were in our own country, the very same
we saw yesterday, no doubt. They were those
perhaps who had blinded and killed the scout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and they were taking our brothers to captivity.
Oh, for the power to strike, to kill those men!
To hurl down upon them some of those big stones,
half loosened by time! We shuddered at the
mere sight of them, a bantering, conceited, happy
mob. The faces of Yvonne and Antoinette,
standing among the crosses, were wet with tears
and convulsed with rage. Hatred was so clearly
visible in their eyes that the faces of the Germans
grew hard and stiffened as if they had been given
a slap in the face. They pass, they are gone, and
now the prisoners are coming. They seemed to
have made up their minds to accept the situation.
They were hot, and talked among themselves in a
low voice. The officers drove in a jolting car,
motionless and spent. We could not see them
very well, but we could distinguish the stripes on
the Captain's sleeve, and then the cart disappeared
from sight at a winding of the road. The way
was open; we went home, and when we were
alone, Geneviève and I fell into each other's
arms, and without saying a word wept again
inconsolably. Towards the close of the day the
garden tempted us. It is a dear old garden, full
of shade and of old-fashioned, sweet-smelling
flowers. It is about four yards above the level
of the street, and if you sit on the wall, as large
as an easy-chair, you can see all that goes on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the street below. Like souls in agony, we dragged
ourselves along the alleys edged with box, doleful
and weary. From the wall we observed the four
points of the compass. Not a Prussian in sight.
So we began to talk to little Mme. Laineux, who
looked out of her window just over the way.
Close to her stood a young girl about fifteen years
of age, whose head, framed in a handkerchief
tied under the chin, was the most exquisite ever
seen. Raphael might have drawn her fine
features, her clear eyes. Even her hands browned
by the sun were pretty; even her waist was
elegant in spite of an unbecoming frock. O
France, you are rich in all treasures, and that
sweet little maid is not the least of them! The
grocer's wife confided her sorrows to us in a bitter
tone. Two old men passing by stopped in the
street to condole with her; then a third person,
shabbily dressed, joined in the talk, and from the
very first proved interesting. He was a soldier,
escaped from the yesterday's fight, and he told
us his adventure in detail.</p>

<p>"Tuesday," he said, "we slept in Arden, a
small place we had reached at five o'clock in the
evening. The horses were not tired, and we
might have marched on. At least, we ought to
have been up at three, instead of which we set
out again at six o'clock, and were not bidden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
make haste. We did not know that the enemy
was treading in our steps. About nine we
approached this place, quite easy in our minds,
when we heard the people cry: 'The Prussians!...
To the right-about! Quick! Quick!'
Convoys like us are not looked upon as fighting
men, do you see; we ought to be a few miles
behind the front. We were but scantily armed;
some of us had a revolver and no bullets, the
others bullets and no revolver. What could
we do against the cannon, which peppered us
from the top of the hill? We were ordered
back.</p>

<p>"The drivers made what speed they could,
when, just at the turn of the road, one of the carts
managed to tumble down; those that followed
at full speed were thrown down upon it, and thus
made a barricade, which held up all the rest.
The guns fired without ceasing. Our Captain
came up: 'Nothing to do, my lads; we are caught.
Be quick, get a white flag.' We looked for a
white flag.... There was none. At length a
white handkerchief was hoisted on a stick. And
then a troop of horsemen cantered down upon us.
'Lay yourselves in the ditch,' we heard. The
horses pawed our backs, and I assure you the
Prussians did nothing to hold them back. I will
show you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>And the man, taking off his jacket, bared his
bruised and swollen back.</p>

<p>"Still lying in the ditch, I noticed close to me
the opening of a gutter-stone stopped up with
mud and grass. I tried to pull it out; it gave
way. I got into the narrow passage, and cried
out to my companion: 'There is room but for
one.'</p>

<p>"'It is one safe and sound,' he answered, and
stopped up the opening of the pipe again.</p>

<p>"For twenty-six hours I lay in there, with the
Germans overhead. Never in my life did I think
of my wife and children as I did then! About
eleven o'clock, when all the noise had ceased, I
ventured out of my hole. People who were
working hard by took me in, dressed my wound,
and gave me civilian clothes. I hope to escape
to the woods and join the French army again."</p>

<p>And so saying the man went away. We called
him back to slip some biscuits and chocolate into
his hand. With a smile he pointed to his full
pockets, and said, "I am well stored, you see.
I will share with the others." Alas, he was not
alone! The convoy amounted to 800 soldiers.
About 15 had been killed, 350 taken prisoners,
and the rest were hidden in the woods. The
boldest or the luckiest might reach the French
lines. The others would probably wander about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
like wild beasts who hide themselves, would
suffer cold and hunger, and then after weeks or
months of this wretched life they would be caught
and sent to Germany ... unless they were shot.</p>

<p>Our thoughts were mournful as death when
at nightfall we climbed a second time to the hay-loft.
We could not sleep, our anxiety was too
great. Were the Germans still gaining ground?
Would they sweep onward, like a cloud of insects,
towards Paris, whose splendour and renown
dazzled and attracted them invincibly? Oh,
may they burn their wings there and be carbonised
to the last one! The next day we went to see
the place of the skirmish. The fields on both
sides of the road were all covered over with things
the soldiers had thrown away. In some places
the grass was heaped with knapsacks, papers,
clothes, and arms. We tramped on; the road
wound its way through meadows and woods, and
then got into a funnel-shaped valley. Here had
been the thickest of the fight. The cavalry came
up from behind; there were the guns on the
rocks to the right and left. Alas, the convoy
had really been caught in a trap! The three
carts still stood in the middle of the road, and
the meadows were thickly strewn with soldiers'
things, papers, and discarded arms. Colette
discovered a beautiful sword hidden in a bush;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
she quickly put it back again, that presently she
might come and fetch it. It would be so much
gained. A passer-by gave us some other details.
There was a body here, another there. It was
to be feared that a few more dead soldiers were
hidden in the wood. On our way back we picked
up all the letters, books, and papers which we
found, hoping we might later on forward them to
the soldiers' families, and at the same time tell
them news of the unfortunate convoy. We passed
through Neuville, and there we saw the ammunition
captured the day before, heaped up in a yard.
Another Cerberus, adorned with a spiked helmet,
watched over mountains of bullets and boxes of
cartridges. There was seven million francs'
worth, said the peasants.</p>

<p>Returning to the village, sunk in despondency,
we heard the sound of a drum, and we
arrived just in time to listen to the proclamation
which the rural constable read aloud:</p>

<p>"Arms and clothes, belonging to French
soldiers, must be gathered up, and brought without
delay to the Mayor's house.... By order of
the German authorities," said the reader, a small
hunchbacked man.</p>

<p>And tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>At Mme. Laroye's we found a change for the
better. The refugees had set out homewards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and the friends from Laon, by taking leave,
enabled us to live once more after the fashion of
civilised people. With pleasure we stretched our
limbs, which three nights had stiffened and tired
out, in a comfortable bed.</p>

<p>From that time Fate proved merciful, and for
a few days spared us new troubles and violent
emotions. Of course tears always trembled on
our eyelids, if some incident happened to revive
our wounds; but after so many mental pangs
the surrounding peace was a solace to our minds.
Life sprang up anew in our hearts, and with life,
spirits. Many a time&mdash;was it a reaction?&mdash;we
burst out laughing, broke into mad, inextinguishable
laughter. Liza more than once set us in
a roar. Liza is Mme. Laroye's maid,&mdash;a maid
who has land of her own, who possesses a mile
away a house, a horse, a dog, and, in ordinary
times, a husband. But, as the times we live in
are by no means ordinary, Zidore&mdash;for he is
called Zidore&mdash;had joined the army, to make war
against the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>Was Mme. Laroye alone? Liza would discharge
with assiduous attention the duties of her
place. Had Mme. Laroye friends or relations
to entertain? Liza went home again, and reappeared
only to give herself up to her menial duties.
Liza is a tall woman, clumsily built, with a funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Hun-like face. Her small eyes, her high cheekbones,
prove that a drop of Asiatic blood runs
in her veins. Have I not hinted, in a former
chapter, that Attila may have sent a reconnoitring
party down here? But if Liza has inherited
her strong frame and her snub nose from
her ancestors, the Huns, to whom does she owe
her restlessness and her pusillanimity? No doubt
to her great-grandmother, the Frankish woman,
who had to submit to the wild Asiatic. For Liza
was not brave; Liza did not dare face the
Prussians. From Laon, Morny, and other places,
people fled to Chevregny. It was then an additional
reason for Liza's fellow-villagers to run
away farther too. The women had made up
their minds to go. As soon as the enemy
was descried from afar, Liza's horse&mdash;Mouton&mdash;and
Mme. Laroye's horse&mdash;Gentil&mdash;would be
put to, and both fiery steeds&mdash;as fiery as their
names&mdash;would take their mistresses to a safe
place.</p>

<p>But, alas! man proposes.... A cry arose:
"The Prussians!" Liza heard it, snatched up a
big loaf in bewilderment, and went full gallop towards
the forest with her dog at her heels. After
her galloped a troop of her companions just as
bewildered. They went down the road, struck
across the country, cleared the hedges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
plunged into the forest. In the heart of the wood
they stopped, blessing their star which had led
them to this wild and safe spot. At that very
moment they became speechless. The report of
a cannon resounded in the air, then a second
one, and a full volley followed. The poor
wretches had thrown themselves headlong into
the valley, where the convoy struggled against
its foes, and the grape-shot fell upon them
without mercy. The harmless troop, however,
lifted up its suppliant arms towards Heaven,
which did not see them at all, for the foliage was
too thick, and muttered hollow prayers to some
sylvan divinity which heard them not, for the
cannon was too loud. Then they ran away and
cowered under the bushes. Shells bespattered
them facetiously with moss and earth. They
crouched in a hut that happened to be there.
A malignant cannon-ball carried off a corner of
the roof. They stuck close to the trunk of a tree.
Merely to tease them bullets tore off its leaves
and its branches, which rained gently down upon
their heads. The unfortunate fugitives, at last
gloomily resigned, sat in a circle, and waited for
the end in the calm of despair. Then all sounds
ceased. They opened one eye, then the other,
stretched themselves, got up, counted themselves,
and discovered with the greatest amazement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they had lost neither one hair, save those
which they had torn in terror, nor one button,
save those which panting fear had burst from
their corsage. These refugees of the forest had
no thought of leaving their precious shelter.
They ate the provisions which in their prudence
they had brought with them, and Liza's big loaf
proved a great success. They spent the night in
the hut, and slept with one eye open, raising their
unquiet heads whenever they heard the tramping
of a Prussian horse on the road. In the morning
nothing was to be heard. I do not know who was
courageous enough to poke her nose first out of
the wood; I expect it was the dog. At last,
however, our villagers plucked up their courage,
and with common accord went back to their
native hamlet. Mme. Laroye did not receive
Liza exactly with open arms, but with that gentle
irony of which she has the secret:</p>

<p>"Well, well, Liza, I understand. 'The old
lady is too slow,' you thought, 'she will disturb
us. She had better stay at home.' And so you
scampered off."</p>

<p>Liza protested, and we laughed, and Colette
pointed the moral of the adventure.</p>

<p>"It is very funny, Liza's story. But don't
you think it is just like ours?"</p>

<p>The Prussians had forced open most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
houses, and had anticipated the taxes which
they hoped to levy. Fowls, pigeons, geese without
number, and even plump pigs were absent.
At Liza's house the ravishers had shown a certain
modesty. A sack of flour, a few pigeons, one or
two ducks only had disappeared. But the intruders
had turned the room topsy-turvy. Did
they look for treasure? And, by a sad whim,
they had seized upon two photographs, whose
red plush frames were the ornament of the mantelpiece&mdash;Liza
in the garb of a nun, and Zidore in a
soldier's uniform. For what purpose had they
torn up these precious pictures?</p>

<p>"And Zidore had it taken the first day I saw
him!" So the enemy had destroyed the fond
keepsake of a happy day!</p>

<p>Really, the age we lived in was hard, and the
Prussians heartless! All the world was so firmly
convinced of this that everybody stayed indoors
as much as possible and ventured reluctantly
out of the village, for fear of dangerous encounters.
No one was bold enough to risk horse and cart
on the road, since the first soldier that came
might requisition both. Happy indeed was the
owner who was not compelled to turn back and
drive the Prussian to a far-off place. Thus it
happened that many a villager, who, having gone
out with team and horse for a few hours, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
back home on foot and alone three or four days
later. From this you may see that communication
was not easy, even between places at no
great distance from one another. An old lady,
seeing the Germans arrive in Chevregny, died of
the sudden shock, and for several days it was impossible
to send the sad tidings to her son, who
was no farther off than Laon. Indeed, we knew
not what was happening in the neighbourhood,
still less at Morny. "The country is overrun with
Prussians," we were told.</p>

<p>So the emotion was great when it was rumoured
that flour ran short in Chevregny, for Chevregny
fed two other hamlets and a great many
refugees. Every morning the baker's shop was
carried by storm. Every morning the housewives
had to wait their turn for an hour to
get a loaf. It was a heart-rending sight to see
how the baker toiled; his wife did not know
which way to turn; his boy knew not what to be
at. At this rate the flour sacks would melt away
like snow in an April sun. We had to find other
sacks, or famine would break out in the village.
One morning, then, Liza announced: "My horse
is required to go and fetch flour at Pont-Avers."</p>

<p>In the country the word "requisition" does
not exist. You are "required"&mdash;that is all.
Mouton, then, was required to go and fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
provender. Very well. He could not tempt the
greed of the Germans, being well stricken in years,
and somewhat lame.</p>

<p>"But who will drive Mouton?" asked Mme.
Laroye.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, perhaps me," said Liza.</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Liza," her mistress cried
out. "There are men enough left in the village
to do that. Now a woman has to stay at home,
that is her right place."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Liza came back, and said in
a triumphant tone:</p>

<p>"The blacksmith is driving to Pont-Avers. I
have told them it was not a woman's job."</p>

<p>The good creature was delighted with her
saying, and repeated over and over again:</p>

<p>"I told them so ... it is not a woman's job."</p>

<p>Alas, how many things women had to take
charge of which were not "women's jobs"!
How courageous and hard-working they were,
the women of the villages! The men had gone
to the war, and left the harvest ungathered.
"The work must be done," said the women, and,
without a moment's rest, they bent in toil to the
earth. We, too, did our share. Perched upon
steep ladders or hazardous trees, we picked
thousands of small blue plums, which Liza
crammed into big-bellied casks. After mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
treatment the fruit was expected to turn
into an exquisite brandy, pronounced by the well-skilled
old gossips a cure for every ill. Better
than that, we shut up with our own hands Mme.
Laroye's hiding-place. For who would have
believed it? Her house was not in order! She
had buried a cash-box full of golden coins in her
garden, but we thought she had better remove a
great many other things just as valuable as money.
Besides, she had a hiding-place. It was not a
fanciful hiding-place like ours, but a serious
hiding-place, contrived by a workman, a past-master
in digging and masonry. The cellar
opens into the arched entrance of the house. In
a corner of this cellar is a trap-door which, lifted
up, leads to a break-neck flight of steps hewn
out in the rock. At the foot of the steps is a
smaller cellar, which is the hiding-place. We
took down the other silver, linen, fine old shawls,
at which we gazed with envious eyes, and then
the wine.</p>

<p>"Not all the wine, dear cousin, not all. They
will never believe you have no wine at all."</p>

<p>When the trap-door was closed, we carried
down with great trouble a few barrowfuls of
earth, which a skilful hand raked over properly.
Then we stamped upon it, swept the cellar,
scattered grey dust over the fresh earth, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
old boxes and tubs in the corner. Shrewder than
a Prussian would he be who saw anything here!
Alas, it was a beast who brought our fine work to
nothing! In the course of time we heard that
Uhlans on their way through Chevregny put
horses into the cellar. The horses, as they are
wont to, pawed and scratched the ground.</p>

<p>"It sounds hollow!" cried the Prussians.</p>

<p>"It sounds wine!" they went on, in a fit of
inspiration, and then discovered they had been
cheated.</p>

<p>I do not know what became of the other
objects, but I know perfectly well the way Mme.
Laroye's wine went.</p>

<p>In spite of these interesting occupations, we
were bored. And yet we had discovered in
Bouconville, three miles off, a well-stored shop
which supplied us with cotton, wool, and stuffs to
give work to our idle fingers. In spite of Mme.
Valaine's anxiety, we went, two or three together,
and brought back in triumph what was wanting.
But we never ventured into the wood, and on our
homeward journeys we cast sidelong glances at
the "sand-pit," whose green shade always allured
us. Such is the name of a few acres of wood,
belonging to my mother-in-law, where I hope
some day to install my household gods. There a
brooklet murmurs, and hard by shall be my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
house, with a willow charming and majestic, an
ash lofty and elegant to give me shade. There I
shall live happy on milk and honey&mdash;goats and
bees will be mine&mdash;with my husband and the
children which I trust God will grant me. We
shall be once more in Arcady.</p>

<p>Thus I mused on my way home, when suddenly
some German troops appeared on the horizon to
dispel my dream of Arcady, and sent me home in
haste to the shelter of the farm.</p>

<p>I have said we were bored. Life was chiefly
unbearable for want of news. What was going
on? For two days we had heard an echo of the
guns. Was there a battle? The first Germans
we had seen had told us with a sneer:</p>

<p>"Parisse, Parisse, within dree tays we are in
Parisse!"</p>

<p>Had the progress of the haughty boors been
stayed? Hope trembled at the bottom of our
hearts; hope, which dared not grow, and which
we dared not avow.</p>

<p>Ten times a day we left our needlework or our
book to run to the garden. We listened. A kind
of rumbling was all we heard. Was it to the east,
the north, or the south? Was it a singing in our
ears or was it cannon-shots?</p>

<p>"What if we placed our ears to the ground?"</p>

<p>And so we lay on the grass like so many dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
bodies, and concentrated our whole souls in
listening.</p>

<p>"There certainly is a rambling." This conviction
filled our hearts with joy and anxiety,
and the whole day long we fidgeted about the
house. Besides, we could not stay for ever in
Chevregny. We had to make up our minds.</p>

<p>"Since the Germans are here, there, and
everywhere," I said, "we had better go back
home, where at least we are comfortable and at
ease."</p>

<p>In Chevregny, to be sure, comfort is unknown.
For instance, cleanliness does not hold a large
place in the people's life, though we had transformed
the bakehouse into a very decent bathroom.
Every evening Pierrot was washed at
the pump, and pretended to throw the water
which deluged him to the bright and passionless
moon.</p>

<p>As long as the weather kept warm it was
pleasant enough, but all the same home would
be better. But before taking so long a journey,
we thought it well to think over it at leisure. A
word from M. Lonet settled the matter. "There
is no danger," he wrote; "some one ought to come
back; the house might be occupied."</p>

<p>If one of us went, then we would all go. Union
is strength. Boldly we had come to Chevregny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
by night, nine in number, including the dogs.
Nine in number we would go home by day. We
had spent a week in Chevregny.</p>

<p>On Tuesday we had Gentil put to. Liza
huddled our luggage into the cart, helped Mme.
Valaine and Pierrot up, and sat on the box. In a
few feeling words, one and all took leave of our
kind cousin, and we followed on foot.</p>

<p>We walked on without hardihood, casting
suspicious glances before and behind. The mere
shadow of a helmet would have put us to flight.
Besides, the horse might be requisitioned, and
Liza left us at Bièvres, and drove home as fast as
she could. In Bruyères we met with a big dog
almost as alarming as a Prussian. Percinet is
fond of fighting, and he cannot bear the sight of
his kindred alive. Two days before he had satisfied
this thirst for blood by killing two dogs. At
the entrance of Morny we passed three riders on
the road, dressed in green, booted and spurred,
with their helmets on. We did not think them
mere gendarmes, as we heard afterwards they
were. They contented themselves with gazing
at the dusty, weary group that went by. At
length we got home. Dear little house! it had
not altered! Its white walls were still there;
so was its grey roof. The Virginia creepers shook
their branches like arms to wish us a hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
welcome. We threw the gate open. The dogs
rushed into the stable at a cheerful bound.</p>

<p>Leaving the luggage in the lobby, we dropped
into the dining-room chairs, and gave a deep sigh
of satisfaction.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>We were at home again! This was a set-off for
the misfortunes with which a wretched fate had
loaded us. The house was as snug as we had
left it, and we had but to return to our old habits.
So we did and exactly! The cake we had left,
at our flight, was still lying on the table. As
we were hungry we each snatched our share, and
ate it with ravenous appetite. It was a bit hard,
but all the same delicious. We wandered through
the house with joy. We were at home again!
How many of those who had fled from the invasion
had renounced the pleasures of home for
months or even years? Some of out friends
at Morny had not yet come back. Yet could
we pity them? A thousand times no; at least
they would never endure the trials to which
the conquered are exposed, and which, after a
momentary calm, once more had depressed us.
The presence of the Germans, quartered in the
village, seemed unbearable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, poor, poor snails that we were! In spite
of our efforts, the flood had overtaken and submerged
us. The tree we tried to climb was too
low; the inundation covered everything; and
we could not foresee the end of the nightmare.
How long should we have to groan and struggle
in that all-devouring water? We besought God
to deliver us, and God seemed deaf to our prayers
and blind to our tears. We called to you who
were on the mainland over the mountains, insurmountable
as the great wall of China. Our
hearts called to you, and no one answered. For
a fortnight the floods had been out, and already
we were losing patience.</p>

<p>Morally drowned as we were, we still had a
physical need of food. A household of seven
persons and two dogs must furnish its larder and
cellar with abundant provisions. The grocers
of the village had but empty shops; our neighbours
were unhumbled, because each was the
owner of a plot of ground. Less favoured than
the poorest of the poor, we had no crop at all.
What would become of us? I have said we had
no crop. I was wrong. We even had a superb
crop. The pear trees, even those which these
last fifteen years had yielded no fruit at all, had
deemed it a point of honour to do their best, in hard
times, and were all laden with huge plump pears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which made your mouth water. They were not
ripe yet; but, determined not to tempt the green-uniformed
marauders, we made up our minds
to gather them. For two days we picked them,
and filled basket upon basket with pears, long
or round, green or yellow.</p>

<p>Then there was the problem to solve, where to
hide them? We laid our heads together, and
by unanimous consent decided upon the deserter's
attic. On one side, the attic was full of faggots;
on the other, behind the chimney that comes up
from the wash-house, there was a floor-space,
about eight feet square, and there we laid our
beautiful pears amid shreds of paper instead of
straw. To conceal their retreat, we heaped up
at the entrance old boxes, hen-coops, and a garden
roller in elaborate disorder. Nobody would ever
have thought that this innocent pile of rubbish
was a treasure-hoard. But we, who knew, put
one foot here, another there, and at a bound we
were on the floor in the very abode of the pears,
where cunning paths allowed us to visit our friends
and choose the juiciest among them. We never
made these visits without a groan, for we always
forgot the existence of a big cistern, fitted up in
the roof, and constantly knocked our heads against
this iron ceiling. But the shock itself kindled our
imagination, and struck out a flash of genius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we put the wine into the cistern!"</p>

<p>We thought we had given all our wine to the
French soldiers, and then we discovered in the
bottom of a box about thirty bottles, which we
resolved to hide from the Germans' thirst. I
must admit that our sobriety equals the camel's.
We drink hardly anything besides water. A
bottle of wine a week satisfies the needs of the
whole family. But, all the same, we did not want
our wine to moisten German throats. So through
the yard, up the ladder, over the boxes, the bottles
went their way. Not too well poised on a tottering
scaffolding I wriggled into the narrow space
between the beam and the cistern. I held out a
groping hand, into which was placed the neck of
a bottle, and little by little the receptacle was
filled. We went quickly to work. My sister-in-law
carried up the bottles with care; I laid them
down with a gentle hand. For it is well known
that a Prussian ear detects the clinking of bottles
a mile off, and of course the Prussian, contiguous
to the ear, being forewarned, rests not until he
has secured the too imprudent bottles. But all
of a sudden I was aroused by a loud shout, instantly
hushed to a discreet silence.</p>

<p>I jumped down from my scaffold, leapt over the
pears, scaled the boxes, tumbled down the ladder,
and found myself in the midst of a perplexed group.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandmother, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Yvonne and Colette, prying in the cellar, had
discovered a fair-sized keg, which gurgled when
it was shaken.</p>

<p>The treasure-hunters thrust in the bung with
an effort, inserted a tap, drew out a glass of the
liquor and brought it to me.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Unctuous, yellowish substance. Was it oil,
or syrup? I looked at it, shook the glass, smelt
it, even tasted a drop with the tip of my tongue,
and then announced:</p>

<p>"It is glucose."</p>

<p>Glucose! glucose! and we had no sugar left!
Every morning we drank milk and coffee unsweetened
by honey. Mme. Valaine declared
my diagnosis right, and we leapt for joy like
marionettes.</p>

<p>There was no more meat, no butter, and eggs
were uncommonly rare, but sweetened dishes take
the place of everything. Baskets full of pears!
A keg of glucose! Thirty bottles of wine! Who
talked of dearth? For truth's sake I must say
glucose did not answer as well as we expected.
When I tried to sweeten the milk with it, the
milk turned sour, and with it the experiment
turned also, to my shame.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by stewing the beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pears with glucose and wine, I obtained an unforgettable
dish, over which a jury of cooks
greedily licked its lips. And every other evening,
for two months, our scanty menu was thus composed:
soup, stewed pears, bread at discretion,
fresh water at will. The glucose went to keep the
wine company in the cistern, except for a few
bottles of either liquid, which we craftily concealed
in the garden, and in case of need we had
but to cry out:</p>

<p>"Pierrot, go and fetch the bottle that is in the
reeds or in the blue fir ... or in the big yew...."</p>

<p>It was much more amusing than simply to go
down into the cellar.</p>

<p>Thus our life was not uninteresting, but our
chief occupation was to watch the horizon, east
and south, where our soldiers were fighting. The
guns were coming sensibly nearer; we heard them
growl day and night, and when it grew dark we
saw shells burst above the hills. We spent many
hours in the garden looking out for these illuminations,
hoping we might understand something
from the way they went. Then came the gleam
of an explosive, striping the sky with a flash of
lightning or with a slow trail of light. The better
to observe, we got up the ladder, and sat on the
wall. To the casual passer-by we might have
resembled a flock of crows at roost waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
gossip's tales. Mme. Valaine had no taste for
these perilous exercises, and contented herself
with the stories we told her. For us the only
spectacle we thought worth while was that very
one which almost rent our hearts. How eagerly
we wished for the shells to burst nearer, nearer,
to set the house in a blaze so that we might be
set free from our chains!</p>

<p>About the 25th of September took place the
first shock between us and the German army. It
was nearly eight o'clock in the evening. The
supper over, I went into the garden, and was
peering at the dark sky, heedless of the cold wind
which caused my hair and my shawl to flutter,
when a frightful uproar broke the silence. Gruff
voices cried out vociferously; heavy boots kicked
at the gates; the angry dogs barked till they
choked.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! what is happening?"</p>

<p>I threw myself down the ladder, fled through
the garden&mdash;those days were full of wild races&mdash;got
to the house, and saw Geneviève hasten forth,
a key in her hand.</p>

<p>"They want us to open the gate," she said,
"and we must."</p>

<p>Yvonne seized the dogs by the collar and
dragged them in. The gate was hardly unlocked
when those without threw it open, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
same time overran the yard. They were furious,
and one of them shouted out in bad French:</p>

<p>"When the Germans knock at a door, it should
be opened immediately."</p>

<p>"You think so, do you, you Boche!"</p>

<p>On hearing us speak fluent German they
softened, and looked at us in amazement.</p>

<p>They all had the same round faces, which the
lantern of an under-officer lit up.</p>

<p>They wanted a lodging: barns, stables to
shelter men and horses. All that was difficult
to get!</p>

<p>"There is room but for one horse in the stable."</p>

<p>"Well, that will do for two horses and two
men."</p>

<p>"And here is the wash-house."</p>

<p>"Six men will sleep there."</p>

<p>The others withdrew to look for a lodging
somewhere else. The remainder, who seemed
to be harmless blockheads, were convoys. We
heaved a deep sigh, but hardly had a mouthful
of air reached our lungs, when the yard was
already swarming with a new mob. Standing on
the steps I engaged in parley with the <i>Feldwebel</i>.</p>

<p>"The house is chock-full, and eight soldiers
are already lodged in the outhouses."</p>

<p>He was young, big, and stout, and his hard-featured
face was deeply scarred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course he did not allow himself to be
prevailed upon.</p>

<p>"It is all the same to me," he answered;
"make room for me if you have none."</p>

<p>He ordered me to open the coach-house, but
when he saw it crammed up with all sorts of
things, he made a wry face.</p>

<p>"And up there?" he asked, pointing at the
deserter's attic.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! the pears! the wine! I was
trembling with fear, and was at a loss how to
answer when the man altered his mind:</p>

<p>"I would rather have a bedroom to myself,"
and so saying he opened Antoinette's door.</p>

<p>"That will do," said the person, and waving
back the silently waiting soldiers he kept but
two of them with him. We began to remove a
few things from the room, which Antoinette had
always kept for herself, and before the sergeant's
taunting eyes we carried away clothes, books,
and knick-knacks. The door we had left ajar was
suddenly thrown open, and a little coxcomb of an
officer came in and cried out in a cheerful tone:</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! Two at a time!"</p>

<p>That was more than we could stand, and
leaving blankets and coverlets we ran away.</p>

<p>At the corner of the house a brutal arm
stopped me, and a soldier I hardly saw in the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
muttered something I did not understand about
money&mdash;five francs. I tried to break loose from
the man's hold, and answered at random we were
no shopkeepers and sold nothing.</p>

<p>"If you are busy," he said, "another lady
would do."</p>

<p>In the dim light of a glimmering window I
caught sight of a Slavonic-featured, black-bearded,
sneaking-eyed face that belonged to one of the
stable-dwellers&mdash;a perfect brute. He looked so
strange, his voice was so peculiar that I suddenly
understood the meaning of his words. Frightened,
I shook my arm to get it free, set off running,
and got so quickly out of sight he might have
believed I had been swallowed up by the night.
I rushed into the house, banged the door, turned
the key in it, pushed the bolts, and even then I
was not sure I was secure. I wished for padlocks,
bars, chains, to protect us against such creatures.
We thought we would never dare go to bed.</p>

<p>With Mme. Valaine I went through the house
to test the wooden shutters. In the street the
carts of the convoy stood close to the house;
here and there we saw a lantern glimmer. Lying
under the awnings the drivers tumbled and
tossed, and from time to time uttered heavy
groans. Those carts reminded us of monstrous
beasts, hunch-backed and mischievous, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
squatted at our door to watch and threaten us.
The yard was pitch dark, all seemed to be in a
sound sleep, but for the horses, which kicked and
pawed the ground of the narrow stable. The
men were snoring; the dogs shut up in the lobby
whined gently. We talked in a low voice and
went on tip-toe. In our own house we felt beset
with dangers and cares. Without taking off our
clothes, we laid ourselves down, our eyes wide
open, our ears attentive to all outside sounds,
our nerves on edge. So we waited for the break
of day.</p>

<p>The Germans got up at the first glimmer of a
misty sun, and we watched them through the
trellised shutters. They had cooked a potato
soup, a grey and sticky stuff, to which they
added some brandy, and which they ate without
conviction.</p>

<p>For hours together they peeled vegetables,
hummed tunes, whistled, dawdled up and down;
but they never drew a drop of water from the
pump, and they seemed wholly unacquainted with
the fact that a human being ought to wash.
Then they began cleaning their arms most carefully,
and deluged them with petroleum and oil.
Our amazement was the same which the sight of
wigwams or niggers' cabins might have roused,
seen for the first time. Their guns, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
against the gate, confirmed this impression. Real
savages' arms, the bayonets were about a hand's
breadth, and notched like a saw. At the mere
thought of the wounds such teeth would make
in the flesh, an icy chill ran through our veins.</p>

<p>About nine, after half an hour's monotonous
shouting, the convoy filed off, and soon after
vanished from sight. As soon as they were gone
we rushed out. The street swarmed with people,
like an ant-hill which a clumsy foot has trodden
on. Well! well! German boots leave traces.
The High Street of Morny had never before
witnessed such filth. On all sides lay dirty straw,
muddy rags, formless scraps of iron. The horse-dung
looked clean compared with the rest.</p>

<p>As to ourselves, we cried with horror at the
sight of our poor yard, into which we could not
put our foot. Oily pools stood here and there;
the pavement, bespattered with mud, was covered
all over with dirty rags, greasy papers, vegetable
peelings, and, overtopping all the rest, what
Antoinette pompously called "human dejections."
And yet in a corner of the garden was a closet
formerly intended for the gardener.... But
such people....</p>

<p>Disgusted and bewailing, old Tassin spent the
whole afternoon in cleaning the yard, and made
more than one unpleasant discovery, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
about 40 lb. of rotten meat concealed in the
straw. The "small room" was in a sorry plight.
The pandours had emptied the ink-pot into a
work-table, scribbled the walls all over, broken
a vase, taken away a woollen blanket, an eider-down,
and a door-curtain. As to the mattress
and the spring-mattress, we could not have
touched them with a pair of tongs, covered as
they were with spots of grease. It is agreeable
to receive Germans!</p>

<p>Antoinette instantly made up her mind to
change her room, and easily transformed one of
the attics.</p>

<p>We went roundly to work, and the "small
room" was soon as empty as a Pomeranian's head.
We had made up our minds that the creatures
should bring straw with them if they required
hospitality a second time. To the King of Prussia
himself we would have grudged a bed, lest he
should leave it in as bad a condition as his men.</p>

<p>The convoy came back that very evening.
Our guests of yesterday went back to their lodging.
Only the inhabitants of the "small room" did not
return. Perhaps what was left them of conscience
reproached them with theft.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the carts went off, and
after three hours' work old Tassin declared he
had removed all traces of their second visit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The whole village complained that the rascals
had not only dirtied whatever they approached,
but had stolen what they wanted, wasted provender
and oats, and had thrown down whole
sheaves of wheat for their horses to lie on.</p>

<p>In the first weeks of the occupation the invaders
bled the country to death. In Morny
they took thousands of fowls, hundreds of pigs
and sheep, and I don't know how many horses
and cows. M. Lantois' black bull, which his
ravishers had tethered to a cart, and then
abandoned in the middle of the road, protested
in a wild, fierce, and fitful roar that he repeated
every other minute for hours together. The
farmers dreaded marauders still more than official
requisitions. For what was requisitioned they
obtained, if they insisted, a note of hand,
often scribbled in pencil and almost illegible, but
at least proving they had been deprived of
something. The soldiers of course took an unfair
advantage of their victims, who knew not German,
and cheated them in every way. We were often
asked to translate such I.O.U.'s as had been
composed according to the writer's own fancy.
"Paid and carried away a horse," wrote one
requisitioner who had but paid with lies.&mdash;"Exchanged
two horses of equal worth," another pretended,
when a broken-down hack had supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the place of a good mare.&mdash;"Received 40 lb.
of bacon." And the honest customer knew he
had gained 450 kilog. on the pork-butcher.</p>

<p>In spite of all, the country people attached
great importance to these notes of hand, and the
marauders gave them none. They went two or
three together, got into the houses when the
people were working out in the fields, searched
them from top to bottom, and laid hands on
what pleased them. They stripped the hen-houses
and dovecots; they would drop in unawares
when the people were about to sit down
to dinner, and then divert themselves by seizing
and feasting upon the dishes before the balked
peasants' very faces. Thus eaten out of house
and home, the village would soon be starved. The
Mayor of Morny and M. Lonet resolved to go to
Laon and seek some protection against the raiders.
The answer they got from the Germans was that,
first, rural matters were no concern of theirs, and
secondly, that the people were expected to give
everything the soldiers asked for.</p>

<p>A word to the wise is enough.</p>

<p>Those who have not known the evils of invasion
cannot imagine the rage and despair
which filled our hearts at being thus enslaved and
ground down. Impotent wrath, overwhelming
despondency took hold of our souls, at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
humiliated and revolted. Like true civilised
people, we could not understand why we were
forbidden to claim justice, to seek redress; why
we were expected to yield to brute strength.
And there was no use to cry out for help, to crave
assistance. It seemed to us that we were forsaken
by God and men.</p>

<p>But was the trap shut tight? Were we, for
instance, whose interests, life, and dearest affections
lay on the other side of the front, without
means to break through the enemy's barrier?
Were we actually prisoners?</p>

<p>My mother-in-law made up her mind to go to
Laon in order to consult competent judges. I
was to accompany her. This poor Laon, which
I had seen but a few weeks ago bright with
French animation, in what state did we find it!
We saw a few civilians only, with hard and hostile
faces. On the other hand there were a great
many grey-clad Germans in the streets with their
helmets on, bustling about in the best of humour.
They seemed at home everywhere, and masters
of all the houses. Most shops were shut up. I
tried to get into the only one I saw open, but
nobody was in it. Only in the recesses of the
back-shop a big hand was busy about a saucepan,
and heavy steps shook the spiral staircase. It
is easy to understand that I had had enough of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it, and that I hastened out with all possible speed.
The sight of their forsaken shops would have rent
the hearts of the owners had they been gifted
with second sight. One of them, I suppose it
was a grocer's, had been smashed to atoms.
Glass jars, drawers, looking-glasses were but
things of the past, and the floor was covered all
over with a litter twenty inches high, of biscuits,
sweets, macaroni, rice, and odds and ends of all
kinds. We went to see the Mayor, and asked
him the questions which we were anxious to have
answered. Were the Germans to settle in the
country? Was it possible to go to Paris? His
answer was like a death-knell.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be done. The Germans were
not likely to clear out. He deemed it folly to
try to go away. I left the room heart-broken.</p>

<p>We arrived in Morny just in time to see some
German infantry march through the street. They
came from the front, and their ill-looks filled us
with joy. They trudged along with weary faces,
and were all muddy, and bent as if with old age.
"Just look at them," we said. "Where do they
come from? Surely they are beaten men. Is
the French army advancing?"</p>

<p>Colette, hidden behind the curtains, never
failed to throw her wishes after the Germans as
they passed through the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Die, die, die. Die, you nasty red-haired
fellow. Die, you fat brute. Die, you young
whipper-snapper. Oh, a wounded man! Die too,
poor wretch; die, die, die"; and the litany drew
to a close only when the regiment had filed off.</p>

<p>"That is to help the French," said she.</p>

<p>Many an adventure befell us in the month of
October. I can merely refer, for instance, to a
certain officer who at eleven o'clock one night
wished to lodge "twenty horses in our barn";
or to four requisitioners who dragged us out of
bed at five in the morning, and forced us to dress
in haste, merely to prove we had no pigs. These
same soldiers delighted to talk German with
French women; tried to convince us that England
was responsible for the war. "The whole world
is against us," they said in a sulky voice;
"the French, the English, the Russians, the
Belgians...."</p>

<p>"But you are so numerous."</p>

<p>"Not so numerous as all that."</p>

<p>I remember also that we were once awaked
by two drunken soldiers, who insisted upon our
opening the window, and who at our refusal
threatened and vociferated for an hour, promising
to come back and set fire to the house.</p>

<p>On the other hand, listen to the tragical,
horrific history of one afternoon&mdash;it was a washing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
day; the charwoman had forgotten to close the
gate. Two or three of us were in the yard, when
a sergeant and four men made their appearance.
Horses were waiting in the street. The sergeant
was of lofty stature, stupid, grave, blue-eyed,
and dark-bearded. He asked us if we could
furnish lodgings for "Herr Mayor and his ten
men." The honour was not tempting. We
pleaded want of room, we wrapped up our obvious
ill-will in a mass of words. Antoinette carelessly
pointed at the "small room," and hinted that
we had no other left. The men withdrew, the
horses rode away, and we sang songs of victory.</p>

<p>But the following morning, about seven, I
heard a noisy knock at the door. I hastened out,
and reluctantly admitted the visitors of yesterday.
From the top of his head the sergeant announced
that "Herr Mayor was very cross, furious even,
that we declined to receive him." He had sent
the ruffians now to see how many rooms we might
place at his disposal. I felt sure anxious ears
were listening behind every shutter in the house.
The alarm had been given, and the sluggards
were making what speed they could. The fellows
entered. The family gathered together, scared
and haggard. A few of them were dressed; the
others were in dressing-gowns. The Germans
examined the rooms whose morning disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
had been hastily concealed, went up to the
attic and down to the cellar. The sergeant
then pronounced judgment in a solemn voice.
We might have offered five bedrooms to the
German army.</p>

<p>Five bedrooms! And we had but five rooms,
containing five beds! Where should we have
slept? On straw with the dogs! That was a
happy thought!</p>

<p>"And you would have offered Herr Mayor
that small room overlooking the yard! Herr
Mayor!"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we had offered Herr Mayor
nothing. But the poor wretch was as much
shocked as if we had proposed to lodge the
Crown Prince in a pig-sty.</p>

<p>Well, then, to punish us and to teach us the
respect due to German officers, we were condemned
to take into our house Herr Mayor and
his ten men.</p>

<p>Death-like silence. A thunderbolt had fallen
and struck us dumb. The soldier went on:</p>

<p>"Get dinner ready at half-past twelve&mdash;a table
for one in the dining-room, for men in the kitchen."</p>

<p>At last we found our tongues.</p>

<p>"You talk of dinner! But we have no provisions
to cook. Meat is not to be had at the
butcher's...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will be provided with meat. We want
wine&mdash;champagne."</p>

<p>"Champagne!" We laughed in the face of
the man.</p>

<p>"There is no wine in our cellar. We drink
nothing but water."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, mind you do things properly."</p>

<p>This was said in a threatening voice, and we
made no reply.</p>

<p>The sergeant had executed his mission, but he
thought fit further to admonish us on his own
account.</p>

<p>"Are you aware that the Germans are unwilling
invaders? They did not want to make
war. Who wished it? Can you doubt? It
was England."</p>

<p>"Was it? Oh, really!"</p>

<p>"And the civilians should be kind to the
soldiers, who are very well-behaved. For instance,
we ourselves all come of distinguished families. A
private soldier is not necessarily a scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I know that," Geneviève answered. "My
brother is a soldier. But as patriots yourselves,
you should understand that we are patriots too,
and that it is painful for us to receive the enemy."</p>

<p>"The enemy! The enemy!"</p>

<p>The sergeant, bounding with rage, struck the
pavement with the butt-end of his gun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, we are not the enemies of women and
children; we know how to behave ourselves...."</p>

<p>While he discoursed, one of the young men
of "a distinguished family," standing on the
staircase, caught sight of my husband's shoes on
a shelf. He seized a pair and put one shoe into
each pocket. Turning round he encountered
Yvonne's looks, and hastily replaced his spoil.
Twice, thinking himself unobserved, he recovered
the shoes. But being too carefully watched he
gave it up as a bad job, and his superior officer
concluded his speech in these words:</p>

<p>"If the French went to Germany the civilians
would receive them kindly."</p>

<p>Indeed! I was pleased to hear it. But if the
German women are ready to give a hearty welcome
to our soldiers&mdash;and that is quite easy to understand&mdash;it
does not follow that we ought to deal
in like manner with their sons and husbands.
We have never pretended to govern ourselves by
the fashion of Berlin!</p>

<p>At length they went away, and we had but to
yield and prepare our saucepans. We would
rather have given a dinner-party to Gargantua
and his family than prepare food for a German
officer and ten men just as German. We went to
Mme. Tassin in our extremity. She would surely
come to our help, in spite of rheumatism. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
meat&mdash;about half an ox&mdash;was duly brought; half
of it was for soup, half to be roasted. In the
wash-house, Mme. Tassin made a gigantic soup,
flavoured with a thousand vegetables. In the
kitchen we peeled mountains of potatoes, and
prepared two bottles of French beans, which a
soldier had brought in, stolen I know not where.
Antoinette, uncorking one of the bottles, broke
its neck, and cut her finger. Her blood poured
upon the beans. Hurrying to help her I tore off
a bit of my finger.</p>

<p>"Never mind! get on with the potatoes!"</p>

<p>At length the work was finished.</p>

<p>Huge and lean, wall-eyed and mouthed like
a pike, Herr Mayor arrived with happy nonchalance,
and seated himself at the table. His
attentive servant for very little would have served
him on his knees. Dinner done, Herr Mayor
required tea, and, being presented with a teapot,
he demanded a liqueur, to flavour the tea. A few
drops of rum were all that was left of an old bottle
which happened to be in the dining-room. I took
it in. As distant as Sirius I saluted the intruder.
With a smile Herr Mayor made a low bow.
Something like intelligence lit up his pale eyes.
He cleared his throat, and faltered out:</p>

<p>"The ladies ... would be ... safer in Paris ...
than here...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave the rum-bottle to his servant, removed
a hundred miles off, and answered:</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>I withdrew.</p>

<p>In the kitchen the ten men seemed to be rather
constrained; they talked in a low voice, but did
not lose their appetite for all that. My mother-in-law
stood by, thinking that too many things might
have led them into temptation. At last they went
away; Herr Mayor too. His servant informed us
that he would come alone to supper, and that he
desired eggs and pancakes. With slow steps the
officer went down the street. Behind the buckler
of our blinds we burst out into bitter invectives:</p>

<p>"Be off, you old cut-throat! you old scout!
You grind the weak; you bully women! You
have eaten my finger-tip and have drunk the
blood of Antoinette! Cannibal! Man-eater!"</p>

<p>The cannibal came back in the evening, ate
a small <i>pâté</i>, was pleased with the poached eggs,
and satisfied with the pancakes. Then he smoked
his cigar at leisure, and all the while remained
unconscious of severe eyes watching him from
the garden. Yvonne and Colette made a wry
face. "The sight of him is enough to make you
sick. Fancy! I saw him put a whole egg into
his mouth! His glass was covered with grease
when he drank. Ugh!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day after, another tune was played.</p>

<p>At twelve, precisely, Herr Mayor arrived, and
calmly declared that, as his servant was out on
urgent business, we must have the kindness to
wait upon him ourselves.</p>

<p>"A pretty request, truly!"</p>

<p>Mme. Tassin was nowhere. The omelette, done
to a turn, was getting cold in the kitchen. Meanwhile
Herr Mayor was waiting in the dining-room.
It was high time that the dish should make the
guest's acquaintance. I made up my mind.</p>

<p>"I will take his dinner to the man."</p>

<p>"Never! You wait at table!"</p>

<p>"And upon a Prussian!"</p>

<p>"He did it on purpose, of course."</p>

<p>I persisted.</p>

<p>"I assure you I shall not deem myself degraded.
And I promise you the man will feel uneasy
sooner than I."</p>

<p>So beneath Herr Mayor's haughty nose I put
the omelette <i>aux fines herbes</i>.</p>

<p>To the same nose I presented the roast veal
with boiled potatoes, which is dear to all German
hearts, and thought I might rest on my laurels.
Then I saw that I had forgotten the sauce. Herr
Mayor was chewing dry veal, sunk in melancholy.
I put the sauce-boat on the table within reach of
his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had forgotten this; I am not in the
habit...."</p>

<p>What did I say? Herr Mayor looked uneasy.
He nearly begged my pardon.... "Indeed, I
am afraid I disturb you...."</p>

<p>Ah! you deign to notice it? And you might
as well have dined at the village inn? But you
don't think that you and your ten gormandisers
have reduced our stock of vegetables to nothing,
and swallowed up our last egg!</p>

<p>But you have not always an officer at hand
to give you information, and so I thought I might
improve the occasion. "What is the cannon,"
I asked, "which thunders day and night in the
south?"</p>

<p>"We have been fighting in Craonne for the
last ten days," said he; "the battle is said to be
coming to an end. Just before we were in Fismes."</p>

<p>Herr Mayor pronounced Fismesse. In a doleful
tone he bewailed the evils of war.</p>

<p>The regiment he belonged to had suffered forty
per cent losses since the beginning of war. He
himself felt very ill. He had slept in the open
air seven rainy nights running. Had I any
kinsman in the war?</p>

<p>"Of course, my husband; and I get no news
at all from him. That is the worst of all
privations."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Herr Mayor nodded assent. These partings
were cruel. Frau Mayor, too, would have given
a good deal to accompany her Mayor. As to
ourselves, our situation might change for the
better. It was, for instance, to our interest
that the Germans should advance. The front
would then be removed farther from us. I
answered that we should welcome no such change
for the better. But suppose that just the reverse
happened? If the Germans were driven back,
the front would also remove farther? Wouldn't
it?</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no.... Really, this war was stupid.
England delights in making mischief, and the
French are mad to enter into an alliance with the
English, when another country was so eager to
come to an agreement with them. France and
Germany would get on well with each other.
What, then, prevents a thoroughly good understanding?"</p>

<p>"A mere nothing, sir; a grain of sand....
Alsace-Lorraine, sir."</p>

<p>Herr Mayor shrugged his shoulders. He had
forgotten Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>His lunch was over. I asked if he intended to
come and dine at our house.</p>

<p>Again he seemed at a loss what answer to
give.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm, h'm ... I am not sure. I will let you
know."</p>

<p>His grey cloak streamed in the air, and Herr
Mayor went away never to return.</p>

<p>Some days after I met him on the road. He
bowed very low, and with a smiling face inquired
after my husband. The double-faced fellow
knew only too well I had not heard from him,
but in common politeness I was fain to inquire
also after his health. Herr Mayor was better,
much better. In a week he would be back at the
front, and if he happened to hear from my husband's
regiment, he promised to send me the news.</p>

<p>And with many a bow Herr Mayor smiled
himself away. His face was not ever smiling.
The peasants were terrified at his way of carrying
out requisitions. On the other hand, it was
rumoured that he believed himself sprang from
the thigh of Jupiter&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;of
Wotan, and spoke to no one.</p>

<p>The family did not fail to exercise its flippancy
at my expense. They asked for the recipe of my
philtres to charm Prussians; they urged me to
write a treatise on the art of training Germans, and
prophesied a fine future for me as a tamer of tigers.</p>

<p>I did not mind being scoffed at. Too many
cares claimed my attention. Besides, Barbu
and Crafleux had just appeared in our orbit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
But I am anticipating. Our chief anxiety was
commonplace enough. The food problem was
hard to solve. Fortunately, in spite of direful
predictions, bread did not run short at the beginning
of the war. Milk we had every day. Though
Mme. Lantoye had been robbed of several cows,
and though children were provided for first, she
always gave us some. We had almost forgotten
the taste of meat. Butter and cheese, hard to
discover, were extravagantly dear, and eggs were
as scarce as in Paris at the end of the siege. We
had laid by a small provision of rice and macaroni,
articles of food no more to be found in the shops;
but we had decided to keep this reserve for
extremities, in case, for instance, a bombardment
kept us in the cellar. We all agreed to live from
hand to mouth upon what we could come by.
My reflections were profound when, after half a
day's search, I found one egg, from which I had to
concoct a dish for the whole family. You laugh?
A proof that you lack imagination. With a
single egg, as a base of operations, you can make
pancakes, or apple-fritters, flower-fritters, or bread-fritters,
or any fritters you like. By the way,
I advise the use of nasturtiums. Rose leaves, on
the other hand, are rather tasteless. But here is
something better. You make some pastry, then
beat up your one egg with a glass of milk, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
crumbs of bread, a bit of cheese, if you have any;
then you pour the mixture on the pastry, put the
whole in the oven, and when it is baked you will
find a dish that will feed six women. Oh! we
made no complaints; not yet, at least. Really
when a <i>menu</i> consists of a potato fricassee to
which laurel and thyme have given a zest,
artichokes with melted butter and chervil&mdash;butter,
replaced by grease, alas!&mdash;fresh salad,
and juicy pears, who would not pronounce himself
satisfied with such a meal? Marmontel,
who loved good cheer, Marmontel in the Bastille,
where he so highly appreciated the fare, Marmontel
himself would have been delighted with it.</p>

<p>The want of light was the worst of our evils.
Petroleum was no more to be had, and candles
were hard to come by. Linseed oil and modest
night-lights grudged us a glimmer by which we
gloomily went to bed. Therefore as soon as the
night fell the fiend of melancholy seized upon
us. The dull light spread a gloom over the room
we sat in, and from the black corners dark
thoughts seemed to rise and grow upon us. So
we would rather walk in the garden, or even
look out of the window, when night fell, than sit at
our work or our writing-table. How many hours
have I spent leaning out of the window in a nightgown,
and watching the shells burst. In September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and October, just after the Germans'
arrival, there were beautiful moonlit nights,
worthy to be worshipped on bended knees;
yet I felt an inclination to imitate Salammbô
and cry to the moon with arms uplifted:</p>

<p>"O moon, I hate you. You are deceitful,
unrelenting, and cold, and even the pale glimmer
you send us you steal. There is nothing true
but the warm and cheerful sunbeams, which
give us light and life. You fling your silver
arrows where you please, and throw what you
choose into the shade. You slip your sly rays
into closed rooms, through cracks and chinks;
no secret escapes you. You favour illicit love,
unpunished crimes, acts of violence, and foul
deeds. All those things you feast upon, O
moon! But your light is never so pleasant, your
caress never so soft, as when you shine on a
battlefield, on places where men kill one another.
You take pleasure in the sight of dead bodies,
shrivelled limbs, wide-open mouths, features
distorted in the weird horror of death. You
play on bloody weapons, on dark-mouthed
cannon; you pass by the wounded, crying for
help, by dying men whose death-rattle is
unheard, and you smile yourself from the charnel-field,
glad to leave the victims in the unfathomable
shades of night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Moon, I hate you! Everywhere and always
you have looked on murderous battles, unbrotherly
contests, man maddened against man. You saw
the formidable army of Xerxes contend with the
Greeks; you saw the Roman Empire quivering at
the onslaught of the Barbarians. But can any
sight you have ever witnessed be compared with
that which you look down upon to-day? Europe
in arms, cannon spreading death everywhere,
thousands of men killed in the marshes of Poland,
on the hills of Galicia, in France, on the plains of
Flanders? Are you pleased, O moon?</p>

<p>Moon, I hate you!</p>

<p>To shun the moon, to shut out the sound of
the guns, I close the wooden shutters, pull down
the window, draw the curtains. The cannon are
not silent. Chilled with cold and horror, I fling
myself on my bed, bury my head in the pillows,
creep under my blankets. The cannon still roars,
and shakes my bed. I wake up, and the cannon
roars louder than ever. To have lived, and have
been sometimes careless and merry, we must
have been as mad and as blind as the moon herself.
But we cannot attain to the moon's insensibility,
and that is why our laughter often turns to tears,
and humour ends in a sob.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Morny being near to the battlefield, we naturally
saw many soldiers. The village sheltered four
convoys at a time within its walls. Officers and
non-commissioned officers were billeted on the
inhabitants, and we had to bear our share of
the common misfortune. And thus Barbu and
Crafleux fell to our lot.</p>

<p>Barbu and Crafleux were two Prussian officers,
escaped from a toy-shop, and carefully wound up
before they were let loose from Germany. They
always arrived side by side, with the same automatic
stride, the one tall, thin, and&mdash;bearded;
the other short, stout, and&mdash;<i>crafleux</i>. I must
explain that <i>crafleux</i> in the popular speech of
Laon means a misbegotten, rickety creature.
The name was not well chosen, for the man was
solid, though ugly; but his round, clean-shaven
face, his pig's eyes sunk deep behind white lashes,
well earned him the nickname. And Barbu
himself was no Adonis. He had a small head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with regular features, a pointed beard, an aurified
smile, cheeks seamed with scars. His style of
beauty is not that which I commend. But what
matters the want of good looks? Barbu and
Crafleux revealed to us beautiful souls; they
were two model Prussians.</p>

<p>One morning, then, the village constable
brought in a smart sergeant, who seemed to have
been taken out of a bandbox. All bows and
smiles, the young man asked for rooms, and we
dared not refuse him. The contest with Herr
Mayor had been a warning to us.</p>

<p>"This will do," he said, entering Geneviève's
room, "and this," passing on to Yvonne's and
Colette's. He withdrew, still with a smile on his
face, giving us full liberty to prepare the rooms
and to rail as we chose.</p>

<p>"Alas!" groaned Geneviève. "Never again
shall I like my room, after I have seen a Prussian
loll on my bed."</p>

<p>"To begin with," I said, "you won't see him.
And secondly, I have a just and clear conception
of a Prussian's method of repose. He stretches
himself out as if he were on duty, and his head on
the pillow is carefully adorned with a helmet. He
is just as proper to look upon as his photograph
would be, taken after a review."</p>

<p>We hung tasteless chromolithographs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
place of pretty water-colours; we took away all
the books, the knick-knacks, and the papers. Here
and there Colette pinned up peacock's feathers&mdash;"to
bring them ill-luck," she said. Then both
rooms waited with a grim air for the unwelcome
guests. Presently the orderlies came in, brought
heaps of baggage, got everything ready for their
masters, and withdrew. An indiscreet curiosity
prompted us to take an inventory of the riches
deposited with us. Yvonne and Colette spat,
like two angry cats.</p>

<p>"Look here! Isn't it a shame? For a single
man, two boxes! five bags! portmanteaux!
Well, if he wants so much to go and fight...."
Crafleux was more modest, but Barbu had
certainly imported a whole dressing-room from
Germany. The day after his arrival he showed
off heaps of small brushes in small boxes, small
creams in small pots, small scents in small bottles,
and photographs and photographic apparatus,
electric lamps and re-fills for these lamps,
sporting guns and india-rubber cushions, soft
blankets and uniforms without number. But he
was chiefly remarkable for his befrogged pyjamas
of sky blue or Chinese flesh colour! The sight of
him must have been affecting when he had on
his helmet by way of nightcap! So Barbu and
Crafleux installed themselves downstairs, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
upstairs. Yvonne settled down in a tiny attic,
and Colette slept on a couch in Antoinette's
room. I gave Geneviève a share of my own bed
in the room which already sheltered the youthful
Pierrot. We were not very comfortable, and
what was worse, we suffered from the cold. This
requires an explanation. Some time ago a direful
rumour had spread about: "They have requisitioned
a great number of mattresses in Vivaise."
Now Vivaise is a village not far from Morny.
"You may be sure they will do the same here,"
said the well-informed. And so, in all houses,
the beds were only half as high as before; and
he was cunning indeed who could say what had
become of the missing part. We, for instance,
have plenty of mattresses: large, soft, elastic
mattresses which would make you wish to be ill
and keep your bed&mdash;and should the enemy of
France rest upon them? That shall never be,
we declared. By the unanimous exertion of the
whole family, climbing, pulling, pushing, toiling,
we succeeded in hoisting up most of these useful
objects, and hiding them in the loft under the
roof. Every bed was left with one only. When
Barbu and Crafleux intruded themselves into the
house, we were hard put to it. One of us made
shift with a palliasse, while Geneviève and I slept
on a hair mattress. This plan is not to be recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
unless you choose to mortify your flesh,
or to copy the fakirs of India. We could have
put up with our uncomfortable bedding if, to add
to our misfortune, the cold had not seized upon us.
Our present guests laid their hands upon heaps
of blankets, their predecessors had stolen two,
and so we had just enough, and nothing to spare.</p>

<p>We went to sleep as straight as arrows, one
on each side of the bed; we woke up in the morning
twisted into knots, one against the other, like
two shivering cats. Despair drove Yvonne from
one extreme to the other; either she lay half-smothered
with heat under an enormous eider-down,
or benumbed with cold under a thin cotton
blanket. The authors of our hardships tasted
the honey-dew of sleep upon beds of down; they
knew not that threatening fists were shaken at
them upstairs, and that bitter invectives vowed
them to execration. Yet I think that when
logs unexpectedly tumbled down, and pieces of
furniture joined the dance, they gave a start and
felt uneasy. But on the whole, as quiet as Vert-Vert
at the Visitandines, they led a happy life,
got up between nine and ten, saw about their
convoy, fed well at the village inn, often went
shooting, or, if they had a mind, drove out to Laon,
came back home to rest a while and dress for
dinner, and then about ten, eleven, or midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
got back into their rooms and their comfortable
beds.</p>

<p>I hinted that war, conducted in this fashion,
was not disagreeable. Barbu knew that I was
laughing at them.</p>

<p>"But our comrades ... who are fighting...."</p>

<p>"Do not lead such a pleasant life ... I
am sure of it."</p>

<p>"And I think ... French convoys take their
ease too."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so."</p>

<p>But really, Barbu, it was only right that you
should live in comfort, for none knew better than
you how to appreciate it!</p>

<p>One day, going in to return a newspaper he had
lent me, I surprised this lover of comforts seated
in an arm-chair, his feet on the fender, his head
resting on a cushion, his back on another, a book
in his hand, a lamp behind him. He looked
a perfect picture of self-satisfaction. But such
delights cannot last for ever. "The present
convoys are going to the front," some people
said. Do you hear, Barbu? You will go to the
front. You will change your carpet for the mud
of the trenches, your pleasant fire for an icy fog,
the studious light of your lamp for the red glare
of the shells! You will go to the front!</p>

<p>They did not go to the front. They were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
pass one or two nights in our house, and they
stayed a month!</p>

<p>The village groaned under the reign of the
invaders. Every morning the housewives on their
way to the baker poured out their complaints.</p>

<p>"Have yours decent manners?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mine are very hard to please!"</p>

<p>And the gossips began to tell their grievances,
for many of these undesirable guests were in
truth very hard to please, and their manners were
detestable. They wiped their filthy boots on
the beds and arm-chairs, deluged the carpets
and floors with water; they burnt the furniture
and linen with their cigars. They came back
very late at night, generally tipsy, went to the
kitchen, searched the larder and sideboard, and
cooked an extra meal with the stolen goods. The
mistress of the house deemed herself very happy
when she was not aroused from a well-earned
sleep and ordered to go and rattle about saucepans
and kitchen ranges. Of course, Barbu and
Crafleux would have repudiated such methods
with disgust. Barbu and Crafleux piqued themselves
on their gentlemanly manners. Barbu and
Crafleux were two model Prussians.</p>

<p>For truth's sake I must admit that occasionally
they came home after midnight amiably
drunk, and&mdash;I am a credible witness&mdash;danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a jig in the yard. But these are venial sins,
and our watch-dogs themselves, who from the
first day had been hand in glove with the
officers, looked indulgently upon such gambols.
Gracieuse was even accused of cherishing a guilty
passion for Crafleux, having once been discovered,
curled into a ball, upon the bed of the gentleman
aforesaid-a most improper act for a lady dog
brought up never to enter the house. Another
fault was ascribed to Barbu. On the officers'
arrival, we had held a secret meeting to discuss
the question of lights. At length we decided to
give one candle to each man, having laid by a
box in case of emergency. The next morning we
discovered a scandal unheard of. Barbu ...
his candle ... a virgin candle, a white, shapely
candle! The criminal had burnt it up in a single
night! A huge candle which in the present
state of things was worth its weight in gold! A
few waxen tears, still hanging to the socket, bore
witness to the poor thing's death. We put in its
stead a dumpy one, whose loss we should not feel
so deeply, and after that he must provide others
for himself. He must provide his firing also.
As a matter of fact he did. One day the officers
demanded fires in their rooms.</p>

<p>"Very well, the charwoman will look after it.
But ... fuel runs short."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbu wrote at once a note of hand, gave it to
the smart bustling sergeant, and the day after
ten sacks of coal were brought and discharged
in the coach-house. We gazed at the black heap
with envious eyes, for we used to do our cooking
and warm our rooms with a poor faggot of
wood.</p>

<p>The officers very well knew that we lacked
all kinds of stores, and Barbu asked me once in
a roundabout way if they might offer us some
petroleum and sugar.</p>

<p>"We have just received an abundant supply,"
he said, "and shall be enchanted if you will make
use of them."</p>

<p>This was worthy of reflection. We answered
at last that we would gratefully take their
proffered goods, on condition that we might pay
for them.</p>

<p>My sisters-in-law made a great outcry against
this proposal.</p>

<p>"Never," said they, "will we receive presents
from Prussians!"</p>

<p>"Gently," I replied. "To begin with, we pay
in cash for their 'presents'; then our hospitality,
forced as it is, is worthy of some recompense. And,
indeed, it is ridiculous to speak of 'their' merchandise.
Is it not stolen goods? Does it not
come from our bonded warehouses and stores?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Besides, is it not a good deed to help in exhausting
their provisions?"</p>

<p>So petroleum and sugar, flanked with coffee
and rice, reappeared in the house, and were highly
appreciated by all, in spite of their Teutonic
origin.</p>

<p>But when the officers carried kindness so far
as to offer us a hare of their own shooting, they
embarrassed us sorely. Though we were not
tempted to accept the gift, we thought a denial
would offend our dangerous guests.</p>

<p>"We have too many," Barbu said artlessly;
"yesterday we have shot a roebuck, seven hares,
and twelve partridges in the wood of Bucy."</p>

<p>In our own wood! Very well, we accept the
hare; it will not pay for the rent of the shooting,
so we feasted upon jugged hare, and found the
very French flavour much to our taste.</p>

<p>Barbu and Crafleux were two model Prussians.
I do not unsay it. I even think I have proved it.
But a Prussian is always a Prussian, and the
best of the brood will never understand certain
things.</p>

<p>"Is your piano dumb?" asked Barbu one
day.</p>

<p>A few dances might have cheered up the house,
he thought, and the roar of the guns and the
clatter of German feet in the street would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
been the best possible accompaniment. Another
day, this same Barbu&mdash;to tell the truth he talked
to me with his pipe in his mouth, but you cannot
expect much from men brought up in Heidelberg&mdash;this
same Barbu asked me if I would not go
for a drive to Laon with him and some fellow-officers.</p>

<p>"It will be a good opportunity for shopping,"
he said. "No? The other ladies will not
either? Last week I dared not ask you, our
carriage was too modest, but to-day we have one
of the Prince of Monaco's coaches."</p>

<p>Barbu still wonders why we refused. Then
something still better happened. When the
officers had settled themselves in our house, we
made up our minds that the Germans should not
catch sight of us in the passage, and the order
was given, "Disappear"; and the Germans never
saw the pretty faces which swarmed about us.
But since I am a married woman and proficient
in German&mdash;my mother-in-law does not understand
a word of it&mdash;I had been appointed spokeswoman
to the officers in case of need.</p>

<p>But one day I suppose the intruders caught
sight of a golden head in flight, and Barbu asked
me:</p>

<p>"There are young girls in the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my four sisters-in-law."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, we had not the least idea of it."</p>

<p>The next day I happened to go into the drawing-room.
The blinds were down, and the door was
open into the passage. An unaccustomed object
was lying on the table. Bless me, it was a box
of chocolates! Delicious sweets, no doubt of
it! And on the cover Barbu had written in his
neatest hand and best French, "Sacrifice to the
invisible spirits." Every one came and contemplated
the gift and the autograph with laughter.
Then we allowed the poor chocolates to get damp
in the dimly lighted room. They disappeared
three weeks after as mysteriously as they had
come, the day of "our Prussians'" departure.
May they lie lightly on Barbu's stomach!</p>

<p>At last the convoy left Morny. On the
morning on which they were to start Barbu
plunged us into an ocean of perplexities by
asking us:</p>

<p>"You do not mind my taking a few snapshots
of your house, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly ... not, sir."</p>

<p>"I should be very happy if one or two of the
young ladies consented to sit at a window."</p>

<p>And nobody had prompted him in that! In
vain I objected that the hour was early, and that
my sisters-in-law got up very late.</p>

<p>"Oh, it does not matter," said he. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
will wait for them. Ask the ladies to get ready,
and we will come back in half an hour."</p>

<p>Think how nice it would be in a year or two
in Berlin, or Leipzig, or Heidelberg, to show a few
photographs! "Here are a few souvenirs of
our victorious stay in France! In that house we
led a very happy life. The young ladies whom
you see were reluctant hostesses, but the French,
breathing revenge, were obliged to welcome us!"</p>

<p>The whole family was in a fury of anger.</p>

<p>"Of course, it is out of the question to comply
with all the wishes of these wretched Prussians!"</p>

<p>Two days before Barbu had invited his
brothers-in-arms to dinner. Upon this occasion
he asked us for a table-cloth, a large table-cloth.</p>

<p>We took out of its dark hiding-place a damask
cloth and eighteen napkins.</p>

<p>"Is that what you want, sir?"</p>

<p>"We wish vases also."</p>

<p>"Will these do?"</p>

<p>"And we desire flowers."</p>

<p>"Take some asters from the garden."</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>"May I take a photograph of your house?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I cannot prevent you."</p>

<p>"Will you put a smiling face at the window?"</p>

<p>No, no, a truce to jesting. Give him a flat
denial. But how? On taking leave the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
would certainly try to shake hands with us, that
is their way, and we were determined not to shake
theirs. Would they take it amiss?</p>

<p>More than once it had proved hazardous to
irritate these dangerous guests. Mme. Valbot
in Lierval saw her house plundered. Why?
She had refused to sew on a button for the officer
who lodged in her house.</p>

<p>Old Vadois, the confectioner in Laon, was
listening to the tales of "his Prussian."</p>

<p>"The people are not kind enough to the
soldiers," the officer said. "The French are
better received in Alsace-Lorraine than we are
here."</p>

<p>"So the French are in Alsace-Lorraine!" the
old man cried out, with a blissful look.</p>

<p>"Soldiers, take this man into custody, he
speaks ill of the Germans," roared the officer.
And they threw the poor wretch into a dungeon,
where he slept on straw.</p>

<p>Our neighbour Polinchard, who is something
of a simpleton, was pruning his pear-trees one
day, when he saw his enforced boarders making
fruitless endeavours to open a fastened door.</p>

<p>"Not through this one," he cried, waving them
back with a motion of his pruning knife, and
pointing to the usual entrance.</p>

<p>"What now!" cried the soldiers. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
threatens us! He threatens Germans! Away
with him to prison!"</p>

<p>The culprit was condemned to two months.
That is why, on reflection, we hesitated to offend
Barbu and Crafleux. They had been kind, well-behaved
men, certainly, but in the village they
were looked upon as haughty, violent, and hard-hearted.</p>

<p>"What will Barbu say," we wondered, "if,
when he holds out his large paws, we put our
hands behind our backs? Will he send us to
prison, and put us on bread and water? Will
he fasten us to the stirrups of his horse and drag
us to Laon all six in a line? or will he give some
such order as this to the commandant of the
village: 'Should an opportunity come, billet fifty
men on these people'?"</p>

<p>A pleasant prospect! The moment was
critical. I made up my mind to brazen it out.
There is always&mdash;I had quite forgotten this&mdash;a
chord, or rather a cable, in all German hearts,
and this chord or cable is sentiment. Let us,
then, proceed by sentiment.</p>

<p>I advance. My countenance is that of an
angel; my eyes are full of melancholy, my voice
is honey-sweet, my hair ... no, it is not dishevelled,
or at least only morally dishevelled. I
began to talk. Of course my mother-in-law had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
no objection to their taking photographs of the
house. But they would permit us not to appear
at the windows. The gentlemen would understand
our feelings. They were men of heart and
intelligence. They had been very kind to us,
and we were very grateful to them, but ... I
became animated. "But we are at war with
you ... we cannot help seeing in you the
invaders of our country, and I am sure you are
aware that certain things are painful to us! You
know how hard it would be to your wives and
sisters to receive strangers. You cannot wonder
at our dealing with you as with adversaries.
And I must tell you that every time I see you I
think with an inward thrill of terror, 'This man
may kill my husband.'"</p>

<p>I had done. I wept with emotion. Crafleux
was gazing at his boots with a shake of his head.
Tears stood in Barbu's eyes, and through this
sentimental haze he saw his wife receiving French
soldiers. As to myself, I felt I would soon have
to blow my nose. My mother-in-law beheld the
scene in silence, waiting to know the effect of my
harangue. It proved effectual.</p>

<p>"Madam, believe me, we understand and
respect your feelings. We have now only to
thank you for your hospitality, and to assure you
we shall always remember it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>They bowed themselves out of the room, bowed
again from the threshold, bowed again in the
yard. We heard the gate close behind them,
a silence while they took a few snapshots, and
then the rolling away of their carriage.</p>

<p>They were gone! Gone for ever! And no
hindrances had stood in the way! They had
gone leaving behind six sacks of coal.... They
had gone even leaving a letter of recommendation
for the officers who would take their place!</p>

<p>God forbid I shall ever revile the memory of
Barbu and Crafleux!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>After the convoy's departure Morny was empty.
The only Prussians left were those who held the
lines of communication and a few soldiers at the
sugar factory. We walked abroad without meeting
the enemy at every turn; in brief, we felt at
home again. We were all like people crushed by
a landslip, who recover their breath, and take on
again their former shape as the earth disappears
which overwhelmed them. But, alas, it was
out of the question to forget the past! Empty
barns, stables, and poultry-yards deprived of
their inhabitants bore witness to the passage of
the scourge.</p>

<p>Other things also proved that the wind was
blowing from the east, whence came the all-devouring
grasshoppers.</p>

<p>One morning, as I came back from a quest after
milk, I stood still, struck with amazement, and
followed the example of the dairy-woman in the
fable. I looked at the village steeple, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
make nothing of the time it proclaimed to the
four points of the compass. Old Tassin happened
to pass by.</p>

<p>"Well, Mme. Valaine," said he, "what do you
make of this? It is German time up there. We
are Prussians now!"</p>

<p>I lifted up my eyes to the sky, and, seeing the
sun, felt easier in my mind. No change there;
it was eight, not nine o'clock. Yet they had
made fruitless attempts to set the sun by the
German time I was sure. That is why I saw
officers cast reproachful looks at the sun, which
dared tell the French time in a territory occupied
by Germans! That was playing them false.
That was treason, and the sun would rue it
bitterly.</p>

<p>A certain regiment, passing through Morny,
chanced to trust to the village clock, and did not
reach its goal at the appointed time. The delay
was the cause of a failure, which put some big-wigs
with helmets on into a rage. In short, the
village constable was ordered to put the machine
right, the German time being the only right time
under the sun.</p>

<p>However, the departure of our guests set us at
ease, and the whole village along with us. As the
village might not revictual itself officially, it revictualled
itself by fraud, and as much as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Now there lives in Morny a sympathetic drunkard
named Durand. Fond of quarrelling as he is in
his cups, when in a sober state he is a good, kindly
soul. He had been invalided, because his hands
were twisted by gout, and this infirmity rendered
him equally unfit for the work of the fields; so he
became a tradesman. He deals usually in rabbit-skins,
scrap-iron, and rags. His business and
stock-in-trade consist of a box set up on two
wheels, and drawn by a good-natured yellow dog.
Scrap-iron may hide a good many things, and
with a view to present circumstances our friend
contrived to extend his import trade. Far from
me to hint that Durand, in ordinary times, snaps
his fingers at the gendarmes and laughs at the
laws, practices as common in our border departments
as unseemly everywhere. But he improvised
with the war a wonderful cunning, thanks
to which he smuggled all sorts of necessary
things into Morny, under the Germans' very eyes.
In his surprise packet were concealed butter,
grease, chocolate, sugar, to say nothing of candles.
The housewives scrambled for the provisions,
which rose almost to the usual level. The weary
dog put out his tongue and laughed, for he knew
well that we were getting the better of the
Germans.</p>

<p>He was not the only one to laugh. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
peasants, too, laughed in their sleeves when they
saw the Germans stock still in "the mountains."
At the first moment of invasion, the people were
struck with dismay. The arrogant enemy, sure
of victory, seemed to meet with no obstacles.
"Handsome men, well armed and equipped.
Ah, there is no reason to laugh at them!" said
the old women. They thought the situation
hopeless. But now it was whispered about,
"They won't pass 'the mountains'; they won't
cross the Aisne." At this conviction their hearts
rose, which yesterday had been filled with bitterness.
Evidently the invaders had been stopped;
they knew not how, but the fact remained.</p>

<p>One morning I encountered a knot of gossips
in the street. They talked of a new attack on
Soissons. Mme. Tassin assured us that William
had said they must pass, and pass they must.
Without stopping in my walk, I interjected:
"And General Pau said that they won't pass,
and pass they won't." It was reported that a
French prisoner had spoken these words in Laon.
Whether General Pau had really expressed himself
thus I don't know. But the Germans gained
no more ground; we were sure of that; but it
was no less certain that we were caught in a trap,
that we could not stir a limb. We had good
hopes the trial would not last long. All the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the situation could not be helped, and we resolved
to accept it. In the village, things were going
tolerably. While the baker's wife, gallant soul,
made her bread, the work of the fields progressed
slowly. They left the beetroots as long as possible
in the earth, expecting that "our French" would
come back before the harvest, which was superb.
At length they had to submit to fate and bury
the precious roots in vast silos. With us the days
crawled by like centuries. It is true that the
housekeeping entirely rested with us; it was no
use looking for help in the village; women who
had not a good many children to look after were
working out in the fields. Only Mme. Tassin
consented from time to time to come and help us.
But how many hours, what long evenings, remained
to fill for six women shut up in a house!
What, indeed, can you do at home but dream
if you are a hare, and sew if you are a woman?
We sewed.</p>

<p>After Barbu's stay a little petroleum was left,
which we used with miserly care. At dinner
we contented ourselves with a night-light, and
when we worked only our heads were allowed to
come within the circuit of the lamp.</p>

<p>We made sets of baby-linen for poor little ones
who took it into their heads to be born into the
world, when their fathers had gone off to the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and had left larder and purse at home empty.
We competed with one another in the making
of caps and shirts. Yvonne is amazingly clever,
and when she has a mind to sew works no end of
wonders in a trice. Our ambition increased with
success. We fashioned web-like laces, and our
embroidery might have aroused the jealousy of
the fairies. Generally we kept silence. Sighs
frequently answered the guns, and if we talked
we poured out plaints of pity for those who
fought, or called up remembrances of happier days.</p>

<p>"Just think, there are people who get letters!"</p>

<p>We moaned at the thought of our deprivation.</p>

<p>"Lucky people! They know if their relations
are dead or alive."</p>

<p>"At this very moment there are some who
read the papers!"</p>

<p>"Oh, rage! oh, despair! oh, hostile
blockade!"</p>

<p>"And there are some people who know the
truth! When shall we see a newspaper again?"</p>

<p>"At this very moment some are enjoying ... nice
things to eat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, for a tea at Rumpelmayer's!"</p>

<p>"Oh, for chocolates from Pihan!"</p>

<p>Such memories did but sharpen the thorn of
our hunger. And yet we had not lost all the
pleasures of life. For instance, do you suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
we had given up having tea in the afternoon?
By no means. It is highly important that women
should swallow something good and hot about
five o'clock. Simple toast was the only dainty
we allowed ourselves. Well-buttered toast with
a well-sugared cup of tea is not to be despised.
Hold! Toast, yes, but no butter! The little
we had was jealously salted and reserved for
cooking. And tea? Do you think tea a native
of the department of the Aisne? Tea was no
more to be had. Sugar was so scarce that we
never ate a single lump without a family council
to decide whether it was the proper moment.
Fortunately I found a recipe of my grandmother's
at the bottom of my reticule. I requisitioned
all the licorice in Morny. Mme. Lantois' walnut-tree
provided us at little cost with a basketful
of green shining leaves. Walnut leaves are like
good women: in the long run they may lose
their beauty, but they retain their virtue. These
leaves then, boiled with licorice, gave us a delicious
drink all the winter, which had nothing in common
with the pale decoctions we nowadays moisten
our throats with at the end of a dinner-party. I
had been careful to say negligently: "This tea
is excellent for the complexion. Regularly taken,
it would greatly improve the skin, and give it a
matchless bloom."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>No one ever missed the afternoon tea. This
ceremony, indeed, was often transformed into a
great patriotic meeting, vibrating with despair
and lamentations, or with enthusiasm and hope,
according to the news of the day. For news we
had, though I said we got none, and it was commented
upon with passion. Our news of course
was all unofficial, and evil or good rode fast. It
spread throughout the country; it floated in the
air; it came from every quarter. When I left
Mme. Lantois' dairy with a can full of milk, my
pocket was also full of news; likewise if we went
to the baker, or if we called on M. Lonet.</p>

<p>The initiated came back in a hurry, called the
whole family to gather round, and feverishly told
the news. We ended by putting a bell in the
dining-room, known as "the war bell." If one
of us heard anything fresh, she rushed into the
room and frantically rang the bell. From the
garden, the attic, the bedrooms we flocked, allured
by the hope of good tidings.</p>

<p>"What has happened? What is going on?"</p>

<p>Marvellous things always happened.</p>

<p>Periodically&mdash;at least twice a month&mdash;neighbouring
towns were retaken by the French.</p>

<p>"You know, that cannonade ... so violent ...
simply meant that our soldiers recovered St.
Quentin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Noyon also was reconquered I do not know
how many times, and La Fère retaken with
bayonets. Once the news really seemed worthy
of belief. The Germans had put it up in Laon:
"La Fère has been in a cowardly manner retaken
by the French." We thought it true. Really,
now, who would make up such an adjective?
The Germans had certainly used it. On inquiry
it was found that the adjective, like the news,
had been invented, and the bill had never existed
at all. Glorious feats were just as frequent on
the front near us.</p>

<p>"The Route des Dames ... you know?...
The French have held it since yesterday. And
to-night they have carried the village of Ailles."</p>

<p>"Really, I thought they took it last week."</p>

<p>"Last week it was a false report; to-day the
thing is certain."</p>

<p>And the Allies! Think how they worked!</p>

<p>"Seventy thousand Russians have just landed
at Antwerp. The English are shelling Hamburg.
Our Northern army is advancing, yes, it is...;
deliverance will come from the North."</p>

<p>Ah, the secret of making legends is not lost!
Popular imagination invents hundreds of them.
But nowadays they cannot live long. Books and
newspapers cut their wings as soon as they are
hatched, and the poor things flutter an instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and then die. But imagine a corner of a country
like ours, perfectly isolated from the rest of the
world for some ten years, and deprived of all
news, all writings; suppose the peasants should
be questioned long after upon the events of the
present war, from their statements you might
compose the most beautiful epic poem ever heard.
As in the good old time, its title would be, "The
Gestes of the French by the Grace of God."</p>

<p>Frenchmen, my brothers, I know you were
splendid. You fought like lions, like the heroes
that you are. Your glorious feats are too numerous
to be counted. It was our despair not to
know them. But, in revenge, we invented feats
for you, fresh ones every day. Once, for instance,
the French, masters of the stone-quarries of
Paissy, made good use of a secret passage, and
leaping unexpectedly from out of the ground,
flick, flack, flick, spread death and dismay among
the Germans; then, like jacks-in-the-box, they
disappeared as if by magic. Struck with consternation,
the Germans would have thought
themselves dreaming had not too many proofs
testified to the reality of the brief apparition.
And what do you think of the <i>chasseurs à pied</i> who,
behind a hedge at Malva, planted a forest of poles
with a cap on the top of every one, and then, when
the enemy with loud cries were in the very act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of rushing upon this trap, shot them down to the
very last man?</p>

<p>And don't let us forget the Africans. Ten
negroes from Senegal&mdash;you understand, ten&mdash;sprang
out of their trenches on a night as black
as ink&mdash;of course we did not know whether
negroes were or were not in the trenches&mdash;noiselessly
crept along the ground through brushwood
and darkness, and shouting their war-cry bounded
forward into the village of Chamouille. Panic-stricken,
the German soldiers fled, while the
officers&mdash;seventeen in number&mdash;not one more,
not one less&mdash;let the Africans cut their throats
like so many lambs. The ten negroes lay down
once more, flat on their faces, and crawling along
on their hands and knees, went back to their
trenches without a tassel missing from their caps,
without a rent dishonouring their large breeches.
These anecdotes were our daily bread. Innumerable
were the villages taken by surprise, the convoys
seized, the batteries triumphantly brought
in. We were always breathless; every one of us
lent a half-sceptical ear to everything that was
said, and tried to detect a little truth among all
this fiction. Who invented or transformed the
news? It was difficult to know. Many a time
Mr. Nobody-knows-who had confided it to Mrs.
So-and-So, who told it to Mr. Everybody. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
generally the information came from the best
sources. If M. H., the Mayor of Laon, had
really said all that was ascribed to him, he had
done nothing else but commit the secrets of our
army to the office-porter or the fruiterer over the
way. On the other hand, it is hard to conceive
how many secrets our countrymen extracted from
their German guests. Speaking of the officers to
whom they gave hospitality they assumed a mysterious
air, and hinted that, walking delicately,
they had elicited from them avowals as mortifying
for their pride as encouraging for us.</p>

<p>But there was another origin, quite modern,
for the news no one wanted to take upon himself.
It was no difficult riddle. The news came from
Heaven. Aviators dropped it. Letters had
been picked up here and there, said rumour;
some of them were evidently home-made, and
were but laughed at&mdash;this one, for instance:
"Friends, take courage; reinforcements are
coming." A touching contrivance of some ingenious
liar to cheer up his neighbours!</p>

<p>Other messages, written in a kind of official
style, were so precise that they seemed worthy of
attention; and one of them, known throughout
the country as the message of Magny, was for
a long time looked upon as authentic by the most
competent judges. Oh, we were very credulous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and you laugh at us, all of you, who read the papers
every morning at your breakfast. We were so
cruelly crushed by the invaders, so uneasy at
hearing nothing, so eager for news which might
have been bones for our anxiety to gnaw that
we greedily snatched at all the falsehoods we
came across, and found our mouths a minute
after full of sand.</p>

<p>Was there no means of encouraging us?
Floods of sentimental ink were wasted elsewhere
upon our fate, but the smallest drop spilt in the
Vernandois or the Laonnois would have done us
more good.</p>

<p>We had not deserved thus to be forsaken, for
we were admirable. I maintain, laying aside all
useless modesty, I maintain that we were admirable.
Our persons and properties had been given
up as hostages. A line was chalked out on the
map; it was the part to be sacrificed. In this
part we were shut up, bodies and souls, with no
possibility of shaking ourselves free. We not
only suffered it to be so; we agreed to the
bargain; we resigned ourselves to hunger, misfortune,
oppression. We submitted to see our
houses plundered, our forests levelled with the
ground, our lands destroyed, so that the rest of
the country might be safe, the metropolis undamaged,
that France herself might be free to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
recover her power and to prepare her vengeance.
Exposed to violence, requisitions, even to reprisals,
we did not give way; we wished for
victory, never for peace; we thought of France,
not of ourselves. But what unbearable pangs
did we bear! We laboured under "the hope
deferred that maketh the heart sick," as the
Bible says. Sometimes we seemed to think the
burden too heavy for our strength and impossible
to be borne any longer. What became of us
when, in the last days of October, the Germans
arrogantly announced that they had won a
victory at Soissons, that they had broken through,
and that they were going on to Paris...?
"Parisse!... Parisse!..."</p>

<p>We were heart-broken by it, sunk in desolation,
and when thereupon came the welcome message
of Magny, full of excellent things, although
scandalously false, should we not have believed
it true? Rather than not to have believed it, we
should have framed and hung a copy in every
house!</p>

<p>The message of Magny made its appearance
on All Saints' Day. On coming back from the
cemetery we watched the shelling of a French
aeroplane, which laughed at its assailant, and
the smoke of the shells was like small round
balls gilt by the sun. The cannon rolled furiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in the direction of Noyon, and we thought:
"If they have passed, it is not over there."</p>

<p>In the village we heard the good news that
every one whispered in his neighbour's ear:
"They haven't passed; on the contrary, they
have been soundly beaten at Vailly. Besides,
aviators have dropped a letter near Magny,
copies of which are passing from hand to hand."</p>

<p>They have not passed! They have been beaten!
Oh, joy! how lovely is the day! And how near
is the Capitol to the Tarpeian Rock! Yesterday
we lay on the ground broken with the shock;
to-day, lively and drunk with joy, we rush with
a bound towards the regions of trust and hope!</p>

<p>Our best source of news was Mme. Lantois'.
The kitchen of the farm is a large, gay, bright
room, whose painted walls, black and white
flags, glittering copper saucepans, and cages full
of song-birds, are pleasant to the eye. A select
society was to be met there about five in the
evening. To find a seat you had to disturb one
of the cats which lay enthroned on all free chairs.
To upset a cat is high treason. To remain standing
would have looked uncivil. I used to get
out of the scrape by taking on my lap Gros-Blanc,
Yé-Yé, or Belle-Limace, who seemed to
approve of this arrangement.</p>

<p>All tongues were let loose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>First, we exchanged and commented upon the
news of the day. What troops&mdash;infantry,
cavalry, artillery&mdash;had been seen in Morny and
its neighbourhood, whether there were many of
them and which direction they took, whether the
trains were loaded with soldiers or ammunition&mdash;these
were the questions asked and answered.
Then we were told what wounded soldiers
and prisoners had been brought to Laon, and
heard what motor-cars had traversed the village.
Twice the Emperor himself was seen within our
gates in an iron-plated car, preceded and followed
by two cars occupied by soldiers armed to the
teeth. Upon this occasion the Prussians of the
village posted on both sides of the road had bawled
themselves hoarse to such a degree that they had
been obliged to run to the next cellar in order to
moisten their gullets. Hundreds of pairs of eyes,
moreover, had watched the sky and discovered
aeroplanes&mdash;English or French&mdash;which had been
fired at by such and such a battery. The German
flying machines had been disporting themselves
here or there. The captive balloon&mdash;"William's
sausage"&mdash;had perched above certain points.
How many of us had, the night before, observed
the signals that came from Laon or glittered in
the "mountains"?</p>

<p>The ears had just as much to do as the eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Guns had been fired from this quarter and that,
German cannon or French, ordnance or fieldpiece.
In one direction a mine had been fired.
In fine weather we heard the sound of rifles or
the crackling of mitrailleuses. One stormy day
the workmen declared that they had heard the
French bugles sound for a charge. What a fine
harvest of news we gathered every evening!
What would we not have given to be able to hand
it on to those who might have turned it to good
account! When we had gone all over it again
there followed a warmly conducted debate;
we drew conclusions as to the successes or reverses
each side had met with, or as to the positions
they occupied.</p>

<p>But as it is impossible always to be discussing
strategy, and as we could talk only of the war, we
fell to telling stories. And many of them touched
upon our general flight before the Germans and
its failure.</p>

<p>M. and Mme. Lantois, with their son René, a
big lad of eighteen, had tried to run away too&mdash;not,
like ourselves, on foot, but in a cart drawn
by two stout horses. The prudent hands of the
farmer's wife had heaped up in the bottom of the
vehicle two sacks of flour, a keg of wine, a barrel
of salt pork, two hundred eggs, and even thirty
bottles of petroleum. No matter whither they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
would have to go, they were thus prepared for
any events. The first hours all went well, but
near Nouvion-le-Vineux the fugitives were overtaken
by the French army. They were ordered
to draw up on the roadside and wait. Night fell.
The soldiers kept on advancing. A cannon
happened to break down and got somewhat injured.
So the weary farmer went to sleep leaning
against a post, while his wife, lantern in hand,
gave a light to the poor gunners, who, cursing and
swearing, did their best to mend the damaged
wheel. The stream of men flowed on uninterruptedly
till the morning. The good people, who
had kept out of the way all this time, thought
the moment propitious to resume their journey.
They put the horses to, and were about to move
forward, when they were startled by a loud shout.
Fresh soldiers were advancing, and ... they
were Prussians.</p>

<p>"I am sure," Mme. Lantois said, "that at this
point they were not three miles away from our
rearguard."</p>

<p>Horses, cart, provisions, and even petroleum&mdash;ogres
turn up their noses at nothing&mdash;were
swallowed in a mouthful. The three fugitives,
despoiled and abashed, came back on foot to
Morny, all whose inhabitants returned to their
houses sheepish and downcast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>In other places the Germans were not even
put to the trouble of despoiling the people, who
of their own free will sacrificed to the new-comers.
They mistook them for English soldiers. In
Festieux, for instance, not far from us, the urchins
of the village cried out:</p>

<p>"The English are coming!"</p>

<p>And the peasants crowded about them. They
had already stripped themselves for the French,
but all the same they were eager to welcome the
Allies. And they poured out wine and coffee,
they offered fruit and biscuits. The woman
who told us this story, after she had shared a
whole pail of lemonade among "those poor boys
who were so hot," went to the tallest of the band,
a man with gold lace, and, in a very loud voice
so that he might understand French the better,
said to him:</p>

<p>"Well, as a reward, you will bring us William's
head!"</p>

<p>The man spread out his face in a broad grin,
and, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,
answered:</p>

<p>"We no English, we Germans...."</p>

<p>Tableau!</p>

<p>This comical scene had its tragic side. In the
same village were still two French foot soldiers.
A kindly soul ran to call them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come quick, there are English soldiers here!
We are all brothers."</p>

<p>Smiling, the soldiers came up.</p>

<p>"You idiots!" they cried, "they are
Prussians!"</p>

<p>And, climbing upon a carriage which happened
to stand there, they opened fire upon the
invaders.</p>

<p>The Germans replied, a refugee was wounded,
the women screamed, all fled and hid themselves.
Of the two courageous soldiers, one, alas, was
killed, and the other taken prisoner.</p>

<p>More than once we heard accounts of the fighting
from eye-witnesses. M. and Mme. Robert,
large landowners of Ailles, told us how their
village had been occupied by the enemy. Every
day German patrols had been seen in the place;
but one morning the French came back. All
fell into raptures, kissed one another, marvelled
at the return, dug up their treasures, and kept
the day as a feast. In the evening the youths of
the village went for a walk with the Zouaves,
listening to the warriors' tales, and the fiddler of
the village played madly the sole tune that he
knew.</p>

<p>The next morning, about half-past five, Mme.
Robert, looking out of the window, said to her
husband:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look, some one is trying to get in through
the orchard gate."</p>

<p>In truth, some one was coming in. The
Germans had arrived in great numbers; they
sprang up from all sides.</p>

<p>Our soldiers were ready. A close fight took
place in the orchards, in the gardens, in the barns,
and chiefly in the big yard of the farm. At the
outset of the skirmish an officer had pushed the
inhabitants into the kitchen:</p>

<p>"Stay there, don't go out."</p>

<p>The defenders of the village had to fight against
fearful odds, and yet many Germans seemed to
play their part reluctantly. Some of them took
refuge in the barns, and hid themselves to avoid
the scuffle. Then a captain came up, armed with
a kind of whip, the leather thongs of which were
weighted with tiny leaden balls, and with this he
vigorously lashed his soldiers until they returned
to the hottest of the fight. The Zouaves fought
like lions, but they were only 250 against an
enemy ten times superior in number, and in
spite of their efforts at last gave way. Another
German officer, noticing civilians in a room,
cried aloud with anger, and shut them up in an
empty cellar. For a long time the prisoners
heard the noise of the fight going on above their
heads, and little by little it became less violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>,
and then ceased completely. Only the third
day, in the morning, were the poor people taken
out of the cellar, half-dead with hunger and cold.
M. and Mme. Robert were still dressed as at the
moment of the surprise, their naked feet light
slippered, he with a night-cap and white ducks on,
she in a morning-jacket and short petticoats.
They were not even allowed to go in for a minute
to eat a bit of food and take clothes and money.
It may be supposed that the German soldiers,
always thrifty, had safely put into their pockets
all that was worth stealing. Accompanied by
soldiers, the poor people had to go on foot to
Laon, half-naked and starved.</p>

<p>"Going through Chamouille," said Mme.
Robert, "I was so hungry that I ate the potato
peelings I found in the street."</p>

<p>In Laon, the prisoners were set at liberty,
and they went to relations of theirs, who did their
best to comfort and clothe them.</p>

<p>"Such rich people, too!" concluded the
scandalised narrator.</p>

<p>Discussions and stories were not the only
things that allured me to the farm. I had a
secret there, the mystery of my life. I realised
a dream cherished since my girlhood&mdash;I learned
to milk the cows. At nightfall I jumped out of
my window, fled to the warm stable, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
strove hard to draw milk from Lolotte's distended
udders. She was a splendid large-horned cow,
which has since been requisitioned so that her
milk might be reserved for his Excellency the
General So-and-So. The good animal mistook
me for an awkward calf, and, looking at me with
commiseration, endeavoured to lick me tenderly.
Oh, we acquired many talents we never had
dared to aspire to before the war. We sawed
wood, we dug in the garden. And everywhere it
was the same; all tried to make up with their
imagination and their work for the many things
that were wanting. René Lantois contrived an
excellent blacking with soot and wax. Our
neighbours grated and boiled their beetroots and
so made treacle that they used instead of sugar,
while a grocer manufactured sweets which were
a great success among the urchins of the place.
And the forest saw more women cutting wood
than ever it had seen men.</p>

<p>When we were dissatisfied with the local
products, we went off to Laon. I think that a
longing for movement peculiar to all captive
animals chiefly drew us to such adventures.</p>

<p>Laon may be small and provincial, but while
you are there it gives you the impression of a
town. You see tall houses, narrow streets, and
policemen just as you see them in a capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Booksellers, chemists, and dentists smile at you
at every corner of the streets. These institutions,
which civilised people cannot do without, are
scarcely to be met in Morny. Therefore, and
despite the uncertain times we lived in, we rarely
let a fortnight pass without organising an expedition
to our county town. Two or three of us
went off, accompanied by the anxiety and good
wishes of the family, and returned home in
triumph, bringing back good news, balls of thread
and worsted for our needles, and on lucky days
a few pounds of provisions.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Yvonne and I went once to
Laon on foot&mdash;the only method of travelling at
our disposal&mdash;with our neighbour Mme. Lantois.
Our shopping done, we could not help going in
the direction of the "Agence," a big building, a
sort of agricultural Exchange, in which French
soldiers were being nursed. Of course we were
forbidden to visit the prisoners. But by good
luck, two hundred and fifty of them were just
starting for Germany, and we had but to wait
a moment for them. We saw them go down the
flight of steps, limping and looking piteous and
ill. They fell into line on the foot pavement.
Oh, what sad happiness it was to see once more
their dear caps, their red trousers, their lively
faces, when we had met only wooden heads for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
nearly two months. Many were too weak to
stand, and they dropped on benches, or on the
steps of the staircase. A Turco sat down on the
pavement with a far-away air. "Mektoub!"
As they were going away we wanted to get something
to give them. Not a shop was open save
the chemist's over the way. We went in to buy
cough lozenges of all kinds. Owing to the circumstance
the chemist let his whole stock go at
the lowest possible price, and his wife loaded us
with piles of handkerchiefs. So we divided our
poor gifts right and left. A big dark-haired lad
felt the fine linen with pleasure.</p>

<p>"A handkerchief! Think, these last two
months I never had one!"</p>

<p>Their guardians did not prevent us from talking
to the prisoners, but when they caught sight of
an officer they sent us rudely away. Most of
the captives had been wounded and taken in the
neighbourhood of Craonne, Berry-au-Bac, and
La Ville au Bois. They did not complain, said
they had been pretty well treated, but they were
unanimous in adding:</p>

<p>"The English are most wretched; they are
tormented in every possible way."</p>

<p>Presently we saw the English prisoners get
down the steps in their turn, half a dozen big, thin
men with worn countenances that moved our pity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>A stout German under-officer thought well to
give us his opinion: "Here are the English!"
said he. "Look at their pigs' heads. They
ought all to be shot; not the French," he added, to
be agreeable, "only the English." We wanted
the poor Tommies to have their share too. As I
was threading my way through the crowd and
they were stretching out their hands, their
guardian, with a blow of his large claws, swept
away the boxes of sweets and put them into his
pocket, amid the laughs of his comrades. It was
too late to make good the German's mischief,
for the soldiers were already moving forward.
The less injured limped quickly away, a car drove
the others to the station, into which no civilian
was allowed to penetrate, and after many salutations
we watched them go to captivity with a
sad heart.</p>

<p>Our visits to the county town were not all
marked by such incidents. One day, Yvonne was
copying&mdash;in order not to lose a word&mdash;the official
reports, in which we read: German victory here,
Prussian success there, Austrian army advancing
this way, English forces retreating in that one,
and, believing nothing of it, she burst out laughing
as she traced the news with her ironical pencil.
A stern-looking sergeant came up and announced:</p>

<p>"You not laugh, townspeople, all that true."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But we laughed all the same. Every one
laughed at those reports, the sincerity of which
was doubtful, which appeared to us still more
false than they were, and which yet were the
only threads which connected us with the rest of
the world.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the benevolent Germans resolved
to keep us informed of what was going on, and
published a weekly paper at Laon, the <i>Journal
de Guerre</i>, which appeared for the first time in
November. The purpose of this publication, we
were told, was to let the invaded know the truth
about the war. Oh! a German truth, of course,
carefully dressed up, for their self-respect prevents
our enemy from showing us unveiled so indiscreet
a person as Truth. And the people laughed more
than ever. They laughed from Sissonne to La
Fère, from Anizy to Marle. I must say that the
newspaper was&mdash;according to us, if not to the
authors&mdash;ludicrous both in matter and manner.
It was written in a language closely connected
with the French. With a knowledge of philology
and some application you managed to make out
even the obscurest sentences. Thus, after a little
practice, we succeeded in reading the new idiom
quite fluently, if we were still unable to appreciate
its niceties.</p>

<p>The first number of this precious periodical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
was a real poem. It was addressed to "the high
and chivalrous sentiments of the true French
nation." Its authors did not despair of explaining
to the French nation that its Government and
its Allies had shamefully deceived it, and hoped
that it would soon see who was really responsible
for the war, what humane and disinterested part
Germany had borne in the whole affair. In
another article peace was openly hinted at, and
the author set forth the advantages which France
would get if she listened to reason, that is, if
she abandoned the Allies and sided with gentle
Germany. And then, forgetful of all reserve, the
Germans added that, in case of peace, the Government,
far from requiring a contribution of war,
would probably be inclined to "build a bridge
of gold to France"&mdash;what a good promise we had
there!&mdash;as Bismarck did in '66 to Austria. "It
seemed weakness," the profound politician added;
"it was strength." If the learned members of
the German Universities had but attended a
common school in France, they would have
learned that which our La Fontaine wrote: "If
we force our talent, we shall do nothing with
grace." Maybe they had understood that sweet
manners are not congenial to their nature, that
the voice of the cannon alone suits their temper.
We should not see them propose to France with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
bows and smiles the fate of vassal that Austria
had accepted in '66. On the second page, the
<i>Journal de Guerre</i> magnified the capture of
Antwerp, and described its consequences in
pompous phrases. Then the author of a small
and acid article concerning the relations of France
and Russia concluded with this sentence, as
witty as it is nicely turned:</p>

<p>"Varus, Varus, give me back my millions and
my billions! If Russia listens to that! It is
very doubtful!" This is a literal translation.</p>

<p>Indeed, we laughed. Not a Homeric laugh,
of course, stifled laughter maybe, a tittering
rather than a hearty laugh, a catching laugh
which the enemy might have happened to overhear,
a real laugh all the same. We should have
felt doubly prisoners if we had not made fun of
our jailers, and to be prisoners only once was
quite sufficient.</p>

<p>As we knew German, we fell upon the papers
we came across and bitterly enjoyed the high
praises they bestowed on their high deeds. They
pleasantly jeered at the "parti-coloured army"
of the Allies, at the negroes who, according to
them, "tremble with cold like a leaf tossed by the
wind," which, the Prussian libellers added, must
produce a bad effect in a battle.</p>

<p>A number of <i>Simplicissimus</i> completed our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
edification. The proud German Michael was
represented spitting his seven foes on his mighty
sword. The Cossacks, bullying women and
children, turn up the whites of their eyes at the
sight of a single Uhlan, and fall on their knees.
In Lorraine the German soldiers, by way of a
change, leave off firing at the French: "Let us
keep a few of them to kill with bayonets," they
say. In conclusion, an Englishman helps his
little Japanese monkey up the noble oak-tree
where the German eagle is perched: "Go on,"
he says, "try to pluck some feathers from his
tail."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>The literature of the day, then, gave us little
comfort. And every week the <i>Journal de Guerre</i>
played the very same tune. Yet about the end
of November we read in its columns a proclamation
from the General-Governor of the place,
which every one was bound to acknowledge
interesting, if not agreeable. This proclamation
brought us the orders and prohibitions of the
almighty authorities.</p>

<p>"It is expressly forbidden to give assistance
and shelter to French or Allied soldiers. Owners
of arms of all kinds, telegraphic and telephonic
apparatus, and bicycles, are ordered to bring them
to the military authorities.</p>

<p>"It is expressly forbidden to keep live pigeons
of any breed.</p>

<p>"It is expressly forbidden to go without passport
from one place to another."</p>

<p>The tyrant who issued the orders concluded
with these words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"The population have nothing to dread as
long as they submit to the laws of war and comply
with our orders."</p>

<p>With our orders! With this you may go far,
and they went very far.</p>

<p>The general regulations did not concern us
nearly. Unfortunately we never met wounded
or straggling French soldiers; we possessed
neither bicycles nor telephonic or telegraphic
apparatus; we owned no pigeons whatever, and
we were content to assure our neighbours of our
sympathy, when, not without groanings and great
sorrow, they slaughtered the inhabitants of their
dovecots. This massacre aimed at the suppression
of all carrier-pigeons, and in many farms
the application had not waited for the law. At
Mme. Lantois', for instance, an under-officer and
two men had dropped in unawares, strangled
and taken away as many pigeons as they were
able to carry.</p>

<p>"Don't take the big white ones," besought
the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Germans are too wise not to
be suspicious; those French people might be
cunning enough to disguise their carriers as big
white feather-legged pigeons.</p>

<p>One night, old Leprince heard a noise in his out-house.
Half undressed, he hastened out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
met face to face four soldiers, who in broken but
energetic language ordered him back to his
mattress. The old man watched the intruders
go away, went to his dovecot, and by the light
of his lantern saw the floor bespattered with
blood and scattered all over with pigeons' heads.</p>

<p>But after the proclamation the slaughter
surpassed any previous raids. It is easy to
imagine the emotion that spread among the
cooing tribe, famous for their attachment to
family sentiments and home life. How many
young ones just hatched were killed! How many
loving couples severed from one another! Bewildered,
the poor things fled in bands throughout
the country, and made common cause with the
crows, pecking corn in the fields. If a Prussian
happened to pass, he lifted his gun to his shoulder
and fired at the white birds. If the frightened
flock sought refuge on a roof: "The deuce take
the pigeons!" the angry peasant cried out; "am
I going to pay 1500 francs because two dozen
birds have alighted on my house?" Then stones
were thrown and off went the birds. The order
was explicit; for every pigeon saved, the owner
was subject to a fine of fifty francs. Therefore
all dovecots were shut up, and no one dared give
asylum to the proscribed. The race of bicycles,
also persecuted, was equally bewildered. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
helpful bowels of the earth swallowed some of
them; the mouth of a well engulfed a few others.
Some I know spent two months in a brook, and
then let themselves fall to little bits rather than
serve the Germans. True patriots were the
bicycles. As to those which had not managed
to escape the Germans' attention, they were taken
to the mayor's house, and clearly showed they
were out of temper by grating, creaking, gnashing
the teeth of their wheels and screws the whole
way long. This did not prevent the invaders
from using them on the spot with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of the regulations as to passports we had a
proof before letters, so to say.</p>

<p>On a certain morning of November, Yvonne and
Antoinette, attended by Pierrot, went to Laon.
For Yvonne a visit to the dentist was urgent;
Pierrot wanted a Latin grammar. About five
in the evening we began to feel uneasy. The
night and the fog fell in concert, and the travellers
had not yet returned. At half-past five Mme.
Valaine and I ventured out, ready for anything,
and at two miles' distance from the house we saw
the little group, walking along very fast, and with
a candid air.</p>

<p>"Why, here you are! Frightened not to see
us back? There was no reason at all! Look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
we have got the <i>Journal de Guerre</i>, a pound of
chocolate, and some sweets!"</p>

<p>We dined with a good appetite. Three days
after we heard a loud ring of the bell, and two
German officers, attended by the Mayor, were
shown in.</p>

<p>"The young ladies who lately were arrested
at the level-crossing live here, don't they?"</p>

<p>We looked at one another, struck with amazement.
Yvonne and Antoinette alone seemed to
be acquainted with the circumstance, and modestly
acknowledged they were the young ladies in
question.</p>

<p>"Well, they are to be at the Commander's
office in Laon at two o'clock. You need not be
afraid, thanks to the Mayor, the affair is already
settled."</p>

<p>At two o'clock! It was now past twelve.
There was not a minute to lose. We were ready
in an instant, and on the way to Laon the offenders
told the truth.</p>

<p>"Oh," they said to me, "we have been so
frightened! You know, we did not want to
worry mother, but you can imagine that we
ourselves were terrified."</p>

<p>"We were already late," said Antoinette,
"when at St. Marcel we discovered that we had
lost Colette's ring. We went back to the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
found the jewel half-crushed, and hastened once
more on the way home. It was about half-past
four, the night was rapidly falling when we got
to the level-crossing.</p>

<p>"'Passports!' we heard.</p>

<p>"'But we have none ... they have never
been required.'</p>

<p>"'Then go back to Laon, you are not allowed
to pass.'</p>

<p>"'Impossible! We have no house in Laon;
my mother is expecting us at Morny.'</p>

<p>"'Wait a minute,' said a voice, and, riding
on a bicycle, an officer, attended by two men,
came out of the fog. We explained the whole
thing in our best German, for he did not speak
French at all. He was courteous, and seemed
inclined to let us go, when he was struck by a
sudden idea:</p>

<p>"'Are you English?' he asked.</p>

<p>"Yvonne understood, 'Do you speak English?'
and answered:</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'So, you are! Then you don't go. Come
into the house.'</p>

<p>"The soldiers gathered round and looked
curiously at us. One of them carried a lantern,
which made all faces red. Our hearts beat
violently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Sir, please let us go home. We are not
English ... my sister mistook your question.'</p>

<p>"You will explain this to me; come in
first."</p>

<p>"The door was thrown open; I stood on the
threshold, when Yvonne caught my arm:</p>

<p>"'Don't go in, don't go in!'</p>

<p>"I looked around me. We were alone among
these ten men, whose looks seemed very strange
to me. Around us nothing but the lonely fields,
the darkness, and the fog. In front of us a row
of untidy beds; on a broken-legged table a
wretched lamp completed this picture of a disreputable
house.</p>

<p>"'Oh no, I pray you, let us go away; let us
return to Laon.'</p>

<p>"'If you don't come in, and quickly, I will
shoot you.'</p>

<p>"And the officer snatched up his revolver.</p>

<p>"Out of despair we went in, the ten men
pushed us and rushed in after us.</p>

<p>"'You pack off post haste,' the officer said.</p>

<p>"The soldiers disappeared, except one to guard
the door.</p>

<p>"'Well, you were wise to come in,' said the
officer, 'or I would have ordered my men to fire
at you.'</p>

<p>"To exemplify his officer's words, the facetious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
guard pointed his revolver at us. Pierrot chose
that very moment to shriek with terror:</p>

<p>"'Oh, I am so frightened, so frightened!'</p>

<p>"We were frightened too, I assure you; yet
we did our best to comfort the poor boy. I
explained our case to our judge, and produced
the twisted ring, the cause of our being late.</p>

<p>"'We live in Morny, were born in Morny, our
anxious family is waiting there for us. Here are
our papers; you see we are French students, and
not English.'</p>

<p>"At last the interrogation was at an end.
Pierrot's tears were still falling fast when the
officer&mdash;a small, dark-haired, Roman-nosed
nervous-looking man, more like a Meridional than
a German&mdash;allowed himself to be convinced.</p>

<p>"'Well, I permit you to go on my own responsibility.
It was a piece of good luck you
met me here, or you would not have reached your
home. Never go out at nightfall without a
passport. Now go.'</p>

<p>"We had but waited for his permission, and
were off as soon as it was given. Pierrot trotted
along, still shaken by his sobs.</p>

<p>"'Poor Pierrot, no more crying, it is all over.
Take this chocolate. But you know you are
not going to tell tales. You may have one
sweet more. Don't say a word of what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
have seen. Mme. Valaine might be worried about
it. Keep these cough lozenges, you will eat them
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"He took the bribe, and, consoled in his mind,
promised not to open his lips about the adventure.
So we came back with our heads high, and without
a tremor in our voices."</p>

<p>"You throw off the mask now! You had not
relied on the solicitude of the Germans, who
wanted to know if you had come home safely."</p>

<p>In Laon, the Mayor, red and merry, overflowing
with fatness and self-importance, told us
simply that the thing was settled, as our declarations
had proved true. He was sorry we had
been disturbed to no purpose. And we too.
To walk for three hours at full speed in order to
listen to such rubbish! I shall be believed if
I say that ever since then we never felt inclined
to travel without passport, which, besides, was
soon afterwards strictly forbidden. The general
regulations were increased by rules peculiar to
every village, differing slightly one from another
according to the local commandant. Those inflicted
on Morny seemed to us the most disagreeable.
They saw the light one after the
other. At any time of the day you might meet
the rural constable in the street, his drum by his
side, a scrap of paper in his hand. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ashamed of his paltry function, being used by
the military authorities to announce to the
world all kinds of nonsense.</p>

<p>"Order to stop all clocks and timepieces in
all houses."</p>

<p>Why? Who will ever pierce the mysteries of
a German brain?</p>

<p>The kitchens of the farms seemed empty when
the pendulums which for ages had animated the
rustic oak clock-cases suddenly stopped, when
in the best bedrooms the shepherds and
shepherdesses who adorned the mantelpieces
ceased their tick-tack. Yet in many a room a
discreet murmur survived, and the owner was
ever on the look-out ready to stop the unwonted
noise if any search impended. Then came
another commandant who did not care for the
order, and little by little the people made their
clocks go as before.</p>

<p>"Order to bring to the <i>Mairie</i>&mdash;now called
Commandature&mdash;one lamp out of every two."</p>

<p>A selection was made, the best lamps were
hidden, and the rest given to the invaders.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to let dogs and <i>cats</i> go out."</p>

<p>Poor pussy was astonished at the obstacles
put in the way of her nocturnal adventures, and it
is said that every garden and field mouse danced
three times in honour of the German Emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>But what seemed to us more ridiculous than
anything was the latter part of this announcement:</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to let the dogs go out; it is
forbidden to let them bark."</p>

<p>Who indeed had invented this fantastic order?
Some old grumbler maybe, who was prevented
from sleeping by a loquacious bulldog, and as
we had relapsed into feudalism, this temporary
lord thought that nothing should disturb him.
I am surprised that he did not throw blame upon
the frogs in the neighbouring marshes. As our
fathers, armed with poles, were wont to beat the
ditches by night, repeating, as they did it:
"Peace, peace, you frogs, let his Lordship sleep,"
so their sons of to-day might have beaten the
marshes, saying: "Peace, peace, you frogs, let
his German Lordship sleep."</p>

<p>Prevent the dogs from barking! Really, now,
we did our best, and for a few days, even for
a few nights, we nearly reduced them to silence.
In our house, Gracieuse, a chatterbox by nature,
had a great many interviews with the cudgel,
which worked well, and all about us the nights
were still. It was but the cannon's turn to speak.
In vain, for the moon appeared, white and round
and fascinating. Her four-legged admirers did
not bay to her in chains. You may imagine the
poor animals, crouching down in their narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
kennels, fastened with too tight a chain and too
tight a collar, lying squat in the dark, and thinking
with terror of the new and inexplicable severity,
or casting a sly look at the whip or the broom
which the master snatched up if any sound came
from their throats. This lasted about a fortnight.
Then one evening a pug-dog stirred up the others
to mutiny by yelping furiously. The shepherd-dogs
followed, then the hounds. And the curs,
plucking up courage, made their deep bass heard,
until at last, their muzzles lifted towards the sky,
their mouths distended from ear to ear, the whole
canine tribe began to bay the moon.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to go out after five o'clock in
the evening and before six o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to keep a light burning after
eight o'clock in the evening."</p>

<p>"How convenient it is!" moaned Mme.
Lantois. "The dairymaid does not live at the
farm, and this will oblige us to milk the cows one
hour earlier in the morning, one hour later in the
evening."</p>

<p>But the dispensers of orders did not mind
putting the farmers out, and every one had to
submit. We consoled ourselves for imprisonment
in our houses for thirteen hours on end by
thinking that in case of a nocturnal incident,
under every roof, from every garret-window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
would spring a head, with which one might exchange
one's impressions. What was something
more of a hardship was to veil our lights after
eight o'clock in the evening. Most of our neighbours
go to bed shortly after the sun, but to
townswomen as we are it seemed impossible to
sleep before eleven.</p>

<p>Our fruit, our crops, our wine were requisitioned;
well, we understood why. But for mercy's
sake leave us our evenings, for none can enjoy
them if they are taken away from us. On winter
nights rooms are comfortable and warm, furniture
friendly, and household gods favourable. Ideas
float in the air and may be turned into talk or
dreams. I warrant, it is the vigil of thinkers
that has civilised the world.</p>

<p>In the morning everything has a cold air,
inanimate objects are hostile, a dull light reluctantly
falls from the windows, and for some
hours you strive hard to tame life again and
make it bearable. I beseech you, let me live in
the evening. The Germans did not allow us to
live in the evening. More than once, when the
bell had rung eight o'clock, we heard fists hammer
on the shutters, and harsh voices cry:</p>

<p>"Go to bed; French no light, no light."</p>

<p>Yet it took some trouble to discover that we
were not sitting in the dark. These people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to thrust their noses through the chinks of the
wooden shutters to perceive that there was no
light in the room. The window-curtains not
being sufficient to mask the light, we set our wits
to work in order to conceal it. Geneviève and I
stuffed the shutters with two big cloaks; Colette
established a cleverly contrived screen all around
her lamp, and Yvonne hung up an extra blind.
Every day, when the lamps were lit, one of us
went out to supervise the windows, while those
within waited for information.</p>

<p>"Is my window all right?"</p>

<p>"At the top, on the left side, there is a tiny
bright spot.... Good, now it is quite dark."</p>

<p>"And in my room?"</p>

<p>"Just a small streak at the bottom."</p>

<p>Into the smallest details of our life the Germans
had managed to introduce something vexatious.</p>

<p>Yet Morny being a quiet village, with a prudent
Mayor at its head, we were not so much to be
pitied during the first months of the occupation.
It might perhaps be thought that we were too
easily resigned to fate, that we yielded too readily
to the enemy's orders. Of course a rebellion,
followed by fearful punishment, would look well in
a story. But to what purpose should we attempt
what would certainly bring new harsh measures
upon our neighbours? Ah, if the least of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
actions might have been useful to the country we
were burning to serve, how eagerly we&mdash;even the
women&mdash;would have risked all to be helpful, and
exposed our lives, our liberty. But, alas, we
were persuaded that we were helpless, useless,
even of no worth at all. We were mere ciphers,
as unimportant to one army as to the other, just
like clods of earth in the fields! I know that a
well-placed clod may cause a man to fall, and
you may be sure that when we found an opportunity
we never failed to make a Prussian stumble.
But it would have been downright folly to think
of an open rebellion, and we knew it well, though
we sometimes talked of it.</p>

<p>The German soldiers said:</p>

<p>"French women not bad; Belgian run after
us with hay-forks." Alas, what a price poor
Belgium paid for her heroism!</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival, the invaders took care
to explain how they intended to be obeyed, and
to insist that the community would be responsible
for all individual acts. The Hussars were very
near burning Chevregny while we were there,
because some one&mdash;evidently one of the French
convoys escaped from the fight, and hidden in the
wood&mdash;fired at a battalion passing on the road.
One man was wounded in the foot. Furious, the
commander talked of setting the whole village on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
fire, and it escaped only because the priest
proved that a soldier had fired the gun and not
one of his flock.</p>

<p>At Laon, a German soldier was killed by a
civilian&mdash;in a brawl after drinking, French
witnesses said; while asleep, the German report
declared. We have read the poster stuck up in
Laon. The end ran thus:</p>

<p>"The house where the crime was committed
has been set on fire, and the guilty man will be
shot. If a similar deed occurs again, the quarter
where it takes place will be burnt, and the town
condemned to pay a million francs."</p>

<p>We did not require telling twice that it was
not worth while. Bought one at a time, the
Prussians were really too expensive. An invaded
country could not afford them at such a price!
Then all power of action had been taken away
from us; we could but try to the utmost of our
power to save as much of our goods as possible,
to set bounds, with cunning, which is the arm of the
weak, to the ravages of the scourge. If impotent
anger often moved the women into tears, what
shall we say of the men? How shall we depict the
fate of thousands of soldiers ordered back home on
the eve of the invasion? They are soldiers, they
ought to fight for their country. They watch
from afar the different stages of the battle, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
manifold din reaches them. They stand, panting,
with clenched fists. They think: "This is going
on, such a thing is happening. If I were with
my brothers, I would fall upon the enemy, I
would fight against the invaders."</p>

<p>Their blood is burning; they wish to kill;
they will kill some of them. A sudden uproar,
imperious voices are heard. Be quick! Prussians
are at the door. They are shown in, even with a
good grace. To refrain so long from murder, for
which they would gladly have paid with their
life, more heroism was required from our men&mdash;the
natural defenders of molested women and
famished children&mdash;than is necessary to rush
headlong into the thickest of a fight.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the regulations the
German authorities had decreed. But what is
impossible to explain, and what people can never
understand who have not lived among the invaders,
is the way the laws were applied, and the
thousand vexations that came from them. We
were constantly threatened with requisitions, inquisitions,
perquisitions. We never saw two
soldiers walking together in the street without
thinking: "Where are they going? What do
they want?"</p>

<p>Among those who were quartered in Morny
during October, were a certain veterinary surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>,
pale-faced and red-haired, and a certain professor,
red-nosed and dark-bearded, both with gold
spectacles. The excellent fellows spoke French
as if they had been born in Pontoise, obtruded
themselves everywhere, and took a great interest
in everything. They talked cattle with the
farmers, flour with the baker, provisions with
the housewives, and sweets with the urchins.
They teased the young girls, and patted the dogs.
After three weeks of such dealings they knew
Morny just as well as the elders of the place,
knew your income, your family affairs and secrets,
better than you. They had a large share in the
writing of a guide for the use of the invaders, and
when every inhabitant had been duly analysed,
both went away to their pleasant trade elsewhere.
You may guess how useful this was for the
Germans, if you consider what an advantage it
would be to leeches to understand anatomy, and
to know the disposition of the blood-vessels.</p>

<p>So much for inquisitions. As to requisitions,
they were always going on, and the farmers never
got up at dawn without thinking: "What are
they going to steal to-day?"</p>

<p>So we continued to hide as well as we could
all that we possessed.</p>

<p>Think of our anxiety the day we heard they
were said to search houses!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning, about the end of November,
the street was suddenly filled with soldiers. The
word "perquisition" was hovering over our
heads. How anxious we were for the cheese and
butter we had the luck to get but the day before!
If they happened to notice it they would be sure
to come back and fetch it. So we rushed into
the garden, and with all possible speed thrust
the three pounds of butter and the five pieces of
cheese, the hope of many a future meal, into the
box borders. Everything was ready. On our
features was a mask of carelessness. Then the
bell rang; we opened the gate.</p>

<p>"Come in, gentlemen, and may it please
Mercury, the god of the thieves, your patron, to
let you pass close to our hiding-places without
discovering them!"</p>

<p>A soldier guarded the door. Two other ones
came in with a sergeant. As the saint, so the
altar. From one room to another we followed
the visitors. They were careful not to forget the
drawers, which their hands searched and researched.
They disturbed the dresses hung in
the cupboards, to make sure that no French
soldiers were hidden behind. They shook the
<i>portières</i>, to scare the carrier-pigeons away. "Ah!
this bed-curtain is swollen ... a French soldier ...
the iron cross for me...." Flat down on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
face lay the knave. Alas! no feet were to be
seen beneath the curtain, nothing but the innocent
frame of a picture forgotten there three months
ago. They went upstairs, took a careful survey
of the attics, pried into the heaps of logs. Then
catching sight of the roof whose shadow served
as a screen to our bedding:</p>

<p>"What is up there, then?" asked the under-officer.</p>

<p>"Up there? It is an empty space between
the roof and the ceiling."</p>

<p>The man seemed satisfied with the explanation;
the big boots got down again; they paused;
they had found nothing. At length they made
up their minds to go out; they disappeared
from sight; they went to search the next house.
A week after these operations the villagers still
talked about them.</p>

<p>"Has your house been carefully searched?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! dear! they have looked even
into the saucepans!"</p>

<p>"They have gone through the papers in my
desk."</p>

<p>"They have climbed upon the beams of our
roof."</p>

<p>The visitors seldom found anything worth
while&mdash;one or two pigeons which their owners
had hidden in the attic, and for which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to pay fifty francs each. Other villages were
less happy. For a trifle a man was considered
suspect, and taken into custody. If a cartridge
happened to be discovered in a house, the owner
was arrested and sent to Laon, Hirson, or still
farther off&mdash;and after the retreat of August what
urchin had not a collection of French and Belgian
cartridges?</p>

<p>A gentleman-farmer of the neighbourhood was
put into prison under the pretence that he talked
German too much! Another was arrested all of
a sudden without any apparent reason.</p>

<p>"But why am I arrested?"</p>

<p>"Go on, you will know later."</p>

<p>The poor wretch came back from Germany a
year afterwards, ill, worn out, done for. Only
they had neglected to reveal to him why he had
been imprisoned.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine how these prisoners
were hunted. A man was arrested in Barenton.
A gun had been found in his bed, it would seem.
He was confined for a time at Laon, managed
to escape, and went right to Morny, where M.
Dunard, his lifelong friend, hid him in his house.
Did any one betray the runaway's retreat? I
do not know, but two days after his arrival an
under-officer and four men came to M. Dunard's,
one from the street, the others from the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>,
turned the farmer, his wife, and the maid out of
doors, conscientiously searched the house, found
the fugitive, and took him away. We saw the
poor man pass between two gendarmes on horseback.
He looked desperate; his hands, tied
to one of the stirrups, were quite blue. But
immanent justice, dear to the Germans, had a
watchful eye. Here it was even imminent. A
good citizen of Morny was just coming back from
the forest, with his donkey put to a cart, loaded
with wood. The ass saw a procession, which he
thought unseemly, and proclaimed his opinion
in the way usual to his kind. The horses,
frightened by the loud hee-haw, reared and fell
back. A military motor-car which was approaching
could not stop in time, and gave a sudden
lurch, followed by a general confusion. Horses,
gendarmes, donkey, cart, and logs fell topsy-turvy
to the ground. Oh, the poor prisoner
with his tied-up hands! Well, he alone came off
safe and sound. He alone, and the donkey of
course. Gendarmes, horses, and driver got up
lame to the right and left, and more or less
injured. After some bandaging the Germans
took their prisoner away all the same, but the
interlude had given a few minutes of intense joy
to many people.</p>

<p>For a long time we were afraid that the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the village would be all taken away. We knew
that in many northern places the male population
had been carried off to fill up German prisons.
When would they do the same in Morny?</p>

<p>"When the Germans withdraw," was the
general answer.</p>

<p>And the expectation of this day filled us with
a mixture of joy and dread. The day came, and
the Germans did not withdraw. One morning
all able-bodied men were summoned to the
"mairie." They were taken in herds to Laon,
and shut up in the citadel; for two nights they
slept on the floor and had to eat a nameless stew.
On the third day of their absence, towards evening,
a joyful rumour spread in the village. "The
men are coming back! the men are coming
back!"</p>

<p>Women and children rushed out to meet
husbands, sons, and fathers, and the noisy troop
came back home, and stayed there.</p>

<p>We thought ourselves crushed with grief.
What seemed to us most unbearable was the want
of news. Every family had one or several of its
members away at the front, and we asked
over and over again, are they dead, wounded,
ill?</p>

<p>And we knew no more of what happened in the
invaded country, in Lille, St. Quentin, or Rethel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
than of what happened in San Francisco, Paris,
or Pekin. Every village was an island carefully
isolated from the rest of the world, and kept up
very few relations with the nearest towns. On
the other hand, we can think only with compassion
of the everlasting threats hanging over
our heads, of the uninterrupted plunder, of the
vexatious measures, which left us no rest. Yet
all this was bearable compared with what we
had still to support! First the bad season was
coming; soon we should suffer from the cold,
since fuel was rare; and even from hunger, since
bread was scarce. One day Colette cried out:
"Oh, mother, look! Winter is coming; the
Christmas roses are in bloom." On the very
same day we heard that the village had a new
commandant. Until then Morny had given
hospitality but to convoys and troops of the
reserve. We should now have to deal with
soldiers on active service. About a hundred
Death's Head Hussars settled themselves in the
big farm on the Laon road, and their lieutenant
became the supreme chief of the commune. The
invaders certainly organised their government.
Every village was provided with a commandant,
who grew more and more powerful. You can
imagine how these people were puffed up with
pride. Just think of a lieutenant, a small country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
squire, owning beneath the sky of Pomerania three
acres of barren, unfruitful land, who all of a
sudden sees himself absolute master of a rich
territory of 1500 souls. It was enough to turn
his head. Von Bernhausen was the name of the
one we got. He was of an historical family, and
gave himself out to be a rich cattle-breeder. He
was a huge fellow&mdash;Geneviève and I reached to
his waist&mdash;aged about twenty-six. Boldly cleft
from heels to chin, he bore on his interminable
legs a kind of shortened bust, a gallows head
with small eyes, a little nose, still less forehead, a
great deal of cheek, and still more of a thick-lipped
and ever damp mouth. This ugly lieutenant
was a thorough glutton, and the poultry-yards
of Morny had many proofs of it. As he did
not walk very upright, his coat, which was always
greasy, formed in front a mass of horizontal
creases that might have aroused the jealousy
of an accordion. Two days after his arrival
he was nicknamed Bouillot for short, a diminutive
of Crabouillot, which means in the <i>patois</i> "dirty."
Self-confident, conscious of the rights his title
and name gave him, this lordly personage went
to Laon, or received his superiors, without any
change for the better in his dress. The peasants
said he was the cousin of the Emperor. We
shall be more modest, and be content with saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that his forefathers are very well known in
Germany and other countries. His faults were
overlooked in high quarters, and I leave you to
imagine the benefit he reaped from his post and
the way he understood comfort, good cheer, and
service. To begin with, he requisitioned a capital
cook of the place, and told her that she was to
exert all her skill on behalf of Germany. A
salary was quite out of the question. Early in
the morning he was often to be seen in a poultry-yard,
busy selecting his birds among the few
geese, ducks, and fowls that were still there, and
then: "I want this to be at the farm at ten
o'clock." If the owner timidly asked for a note
of hand, the officer turned short round and
shouted in his face: "I told you to bring me
this at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>Once he came to M. Lantois and said:
"I want the carriage you've got; bring it to
me." The farmer, after a moment's hesitation,
dared to pronounce, too, the words "note of
hand."</p>

<p>"I shall give none; you don't want any; your
cart won't get lost."</p>

<p>Suddenly the man went into a regular rage,
tore up and down the yard, uttered yells of anger,
and bellowed:</p>

<p>"I am the commandant of this village! I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
do everything I please! You must give me all
that I want!"</p>

<p>He took the carriage away, and two days
later it was lying broken in a ditch.</p>

<p>Thus we had nothing to do but suffer these
exactions. We had marched straight back
towards the Middle Ages. We were bondsmen,
attached to the soil, as no one was allowed to
leave the land. The mighty and powerful lords
had re-established all feudal rights. They took
toll for the shortest journeys, sold our own flour
in common mills, from all men required villein
service. They were careful not to forget certain
prerogatives, and thought they had a double
right to the favour of all women and girls, being
at once lords and conquerors. Accordingly a
house like ours seemed to them especially created
for the pleasure of the King of Prussia's officers.</p>

<p>And yet how careful we were to hide ourselves!
From the moment that the hussars
haunted the country, Mme. Valaine did not allow
us even to go and fetch the bread. The bakehouse
was deemed too far off, and the garden
sufficient for exercise. Mme. Lantois' farm, M.
Lonet's house, a hundred yards to the right, a
hundred yards to the left, were the longest walks
we were permitted to enjoy. And before risking
our nose in the street we took a rapid survey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"No Prussian is to be seen? Good, I will
risk it."</p>

<p>Despite these precautions, we were forced to
receive frequent requisitioners or perquisitioners,
and we soon heard that the soldiers called our
habitation "the house of the pretty girls."</p>

<p>Fatal name! No sooner had Lieutenant von
Bernhausen heard it than he despatched to us
his second self, the sergeant Marquis, <i>alias</i> Sainte-Brute.
For, as no one can doubt, Bouillot had
about him worthy followers&mdash;this sergeant,
Sainte-Brute, as much dreaded as his master,
and a few other hussars, "he loved above all,"
as Victor Hugo says. Was it "for their great
courage and their huge size"? I do not know,
but for their ferocity in any case, their want of
scruple, their hatred of France. Among them he
reckoned "the Blackguard," a vicious lad with
a pink and white complexion; "Rabbit's Paw,"
who looked like a degenerate fool, with a long
bovine face; and the "Japanese," whose slanting,
spiteful eyes were always laughing.</p>

<p>One evening, when all the inhabitants of the
village had locked up their houses, a loud ring was
heard at our gate. This made our hearts beat
quickly.</p>

<p>"So late, O heavens! what do they want?"</p>

<p>We ran out, and soon showed in Sainte-Brute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
attended by two soldiers. Like a conqueror he
walked up the steps and entered the dining-room.
He showed his best graces, his small moustache
was curled up, his cloak put on after the Spanish
fashion, his cap roguishly set on one side. A
paper in his hands, he made a show of his fingers&mdash;he
had well-kept nails, I must acknowledge. Mme.
Valaine, Geneviève, and I stood and waited. A
night-light illumined the scene.</p>

<p>"It is six o'clock," the under-officer announced.
"Everybody must be at home. I want to see
all the inhabitants of this house."</p>

<p>Come along, then! Let him count us; set
the family in a row; it is fair-day; the Germans
are amusing themselves!</p>

<p>The girls came in reluctantly with fury-flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>Sainte-Brute thought the light too weak; he
pointed his electric lamp at us, and one after another
scanned our hostile faces; then he declared:</p>

<p>"The 'population' say that you often go to
Laon without passports."</p>

<p>"If the population say so, it is lying. In the
last ten days we have been but once to Laon, and
here is the passport you gave us yourself."</p>

<p>"Hum, hum, the population...."</p>

<p>Sainte-Brute seemed to hesitate. The Blackguard
plucked him by the sleeve:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come...."</p>

<p>"Mind, you have had your warning," the
sergeant concluded by saying. "It is strictly forbidden
to travel without leave from the military
authorities."</p>

<p>Satisfied with his speech, the man withdrew.
He took a careful survey of the lobby, opened the
kitchen door, cast his light in every direction.
He seemed to take a great interest in the copper
of the saucepans. Yet he went out, followed by
his acolytes. Their steps resounded in the street.
We bolted the door, and an hour after had not
recovered from the emotion.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of this visit?</p>

<p>The next day, under the pretence that he
wanted to see what lodging we might give to
chance soldiers, Bouillot himself came to see us
with his train. At his heels was a big hound.
Percinet did not believe his eyes. A dog in his
yard! He flung himself on the intruder; a
furious fight began; with his heavy boots the
officer gave our poor collie many a hard kick,
and at length knocked him down.</p>

<p>"Brute!" cried Colette, in an indignant tone.</p>

<p>Herr von Bernhausen replied with a smile.
He was kind enough to believe the epithet was
meant for the dog.</p>

<p>While Yvonne was taking away the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
limping beast, the lieutenant asked a few questions,
then turned on his heels and went away.
Once in the street, he lifted up his long arms, as
if to say:</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do in this house!"</p>

<p>He had pronounced our sentence; the reign of
terror had begun.</p>

<p>Were I to live a hundred years I should never
forget the weeks of mental torture I owe to the
Germans. Ten times a day terror sent all the
blood of my veins to my heart, and made my
legs shake under me. Ten times a night terror
awoke me panting from my sleep, with my eyes
swimming with tears.</p>

<p>Is any one coming in? Is there a knock at
the door? Is the bell ringing?</p>

<p>For we had been officially chosen as butts, and
at any time, under the most futile pretences, two
or three hussars, or a troop of them, used to enter
the house. They well-nigh forced the gate open,
or broke the bell, and roaring out horribly one
day required harness we never had, another
maintained they would find in our garden their
horses broken loose. Then, at nightfall, when
our neighbours were all shut up in their houses,
they would come back and stay in front of the
house. More than once they arrived drunk, and
all the while they made a frightful uproar, shouting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
calling after us, kicking in the gates, knocking
at the shutters with their revolvers, and trying
to break them open. If from upstairs we asked
what they wanted, they answered with threats,
insults, and invitations to come down.</p>

<p>This life was a very hell.</p>

<p>For weeks we kept a ladder raised against the
wall so that if the soldiers, more intoxicated than
usual, managed to force a shutter open and
entered the house we might escape. Thanks to a
small pent-house built on the other side of the
wall, we could in a few steps be in Mme. Lantois'
orchard.</p>

<p>The farmer's wife had said to us:</p>

<p>"Do come in case of an emergency. The doors
overlooking the garden are never locked, and if
you were pursued my husband and son would
take a hay-fork to defend you."</p>

<p>Colette, who now slept in the big room upstairs,
had a hatchet nigh at hand.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "if they got up to my room,
I would split two or three heads before I jumped
out of the window!"</p>

<p>Of a certainty we had a very large share in the
distribution of cares, yet the sun shone&mdash;or rather
the wind blew&mdash;for every one. It is useless to
say that the hussars were prompt of hand, and
were not always satisfied with threats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
One day Lieutenant von Bernhausen had a
mind to go to Laon with his retinue. He sent for
the Mayor of Morny:</p>

<p>"Make haste, I want three coaches put to at
eleven o'clock. Be off!"</p>

<p>Bewildered, the Mayor hurried away to carry
out the order. Where would he get three coaches
whose wheels would hold together, three horses
whose legs would not shake under them, whose
backs would not be covered with bruises and
scabs, when the farmers were all eaten out of
house and home? Besides, the less sorry jades
were out in the fields at that time of the day.
By dint of researches and efforts, three decent
coaches were got together at length. But it was
half-past eleven.</p>

<p>For thirteen minutes the commandant had
been making the air echo with the thunder of his
wrath, and when he saw the Mayor red in the
face and out of breath, he rushed towards him
with a stick, and vigorously beat the shoulders of
the unfortunate magistrate.</p>

<p>Such is the proper way to deal with French
people.</p>

<p>Let us be just. The following day the same
Bernhausen dusted the jacket of one of his own
soldiers, who had ventured to kick a civilian.
Yet it is worth remarking that the rascal did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
get punished on account of the ill-usage inflicted
on a defenceless person, but for the insolence he
had shown by encroaching on his superior's rights.
Gold lace alone empowers you to distribute hard
thumps and blows.</p>

<p>One farm on the Laon road, being in a conspicuous
place, had to suffer particularly from the
plunderers and requisitioners who happened to
pass by. One day Mme. Vialat could not succeed
even in giving her sick child something hot. As
soon as anything was ready the soldiers rushed
forward, took it away, and laughed at the thought
that they had played a nice little trick.</p>

<p>There remained in the house a certain number
of sheepskins, carefully prepared, and not less
carefully hidden. One day the hussars discovered
and laid hold of the treasure. The farmer
lost his temper, and tried to defend his goods.
Too many things had already been stolen; he
required a note of hand; but Sainte-Brute never
gave notes of hand. Things were growing bad;
the farmer could not keep down his anger, and
gave the plunderers a piece of his mind. The
soldiers threw themselves upon him; Mme.
Vialat and her niece ran to the rescue.</p>

<p>"They might have killed him," the young
girl told us. "I came and stood before him."</p>

<p>The brutes gave her a sound slap on the face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
struck her aunt with the butt-end of their guns,
and on their own private authority carried away
the precious skins.</p>

<p>A young shopkeeper of the village, Mlle.
Grellet, objected to a close search into her own
linen. The soldiers had no chance of success, as
they were looking for a missing wheel. But the
sergeant pretended that no one dared withstand
his will, and with a hoarse laugh he rudely knocked
the girl about.</p>

<p>Indignant, she struck him on the face. She
was directly knocked down, her features belaboured
with clenched fists, and justice was
demanded of the commandant. The poor girl
was immediately sentenced to three days' imprisonment.
We saw her taken to the "mairie,"
she was shaken with sobs, her bloody face all
bruised and swollen. She was guilty of having
inflicted serious ill-treatment on the person of
the rosy, smiling, and triumphant sergeant who
was accompanying her.</p>

<p>As to ourselves, the witnesses of these chivalrous
deeds, we looked on, with our fists clenched,
with our teeth grinding, with tears of rage in our
eyes ... and never uttered a word.</p>

<p>It was no use crying for help. Our very
prayers seemed to rise to an unrelenting God, and
we could but murmur:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, Father, why hast Thou forsaken us?"</p>

<p>It was the reign of terror.</p>

<p>"Ah, Madam," said a woman all in tears,
whose husband owned a merry-go-round, "they
have just requisitioned our mechanical organ.
Ah, Madam, such a beautiful 'music,' for
which we had given four thousand francs&mdash;all
our savings! They have taken it to amuse
themselves. And how furious they were! When
they are well spoken I don't mind it so much,
but when they look so angry I tremble like a
leaf."</p>

<p>It was the reign of terror.</p>

<p>"When I see them coming," another neighbour
declared, "it makes my blood run cold."</p>

<p>M. Lonet himself acknowledged that he never
saw Prussians enter his house without an inward
thrill of fear.</p>

<p>"Whom will they harm to-day?" we thought.
"People, animals, or things?"</p>

<p>It was the reign of terror.</p>

<p>When the invaders alarmed strong and courageous
men, I, who am not a thunderbolt of war,
how could I put a good face on the matter?
Geneviève, on the other hand, was more indignant
than frightened, but, as to myself, I was frightened
to death.</p>

<p>It was the reign of terror, terror, terror. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
you do not understand the meaning of this, you
who have not rushed to your light to blow it
out for fear its pale glimmer would betray your
presence, who have not stopped panting in the
dark to listen to angry yells uttered close to your
windows, to hear your shutters shake and creak
under the assailants' blows&mdash;you who have not
realised that you are a woman and weak, and that
a dozen brutes will seek more than your life if
they succeed in their design. You do not know
what it is like, but we know it from sad experience,
and if the horrors that have overwhelmed
other places have been spared us, at least we have
felt their envenomed breath, and our bodies and
souls have not yet set themselves free from the
poison.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>Thus ground down and sunk in grief we reached
the end of the year. You must not think that
we were as yet urged to desperation. The
courageous inhabitants who, after hours' waiting,
got a passport to go to Laon always came back
with the most comforting information.</p>

<p>"The news is very good ... very good. I
should not be astonished if the Germans went
away in a short time."</p>

<p>The farmer's wife of the "Huchettes" who
daily took milk to Laon&mdash;so many bottles were
requisitioned for the Red Cross&mdash;mysteriously
said with her forefinger lifted up:</p>

<p>"I have good hope, good hope, that 'our
French' will be back before the 1st of January."</p>

<p>And the cannon was ever booming; its voice
cheered us; we never got weary of listening to
it and studying it. Once we even believed that
it promised our deliverance. It was the 21st
of December, at about eleven in the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Geneviève and I were gloomily reading books
held quite close to the light, when Colette
knocked at our door and appeared in her nightgown:</p>

<p>"Come, come, a battle is being fought just now,
don't you hear the cannon? It is roaring louder
than ever."</p>

<p>On tiptoe, for fear we should arouse Mme.
Valaine from her sleep, we went upstairs.
Colette's window was wide open; we squeezed
together in the narrow space. Both Geneviève
and I got upon the window-sill and leaned against
the frame, whilst the others pressed against the
rail in front. And there, half-dressed, unconscious
of the cold, we eagerly watched the horizon.
The action took place in the direction of Vailly.
In fact, the cannon was roaring with a rage never
yet heard. Its near or distant rumbling never
ceased for a second, and the bursting shells
succeeded one another uninterruptedly. When
certain pieces of ordnance were firing off full
volleys, we felt a quivering all about us, and on
the writing-table the penholder jingled against
the crystal of the inkstand. Our bodies, our
souls thrilled with enthusiasm, and the battle
awoke an inward echo. With our minds' eyes
we eagerly watched the place where great things
happened. Our hearts flew onward to meet those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
who seemed to approach us!... Oh, come,
come!</p>

<p>Our eyes were riveted on the horizon in flames,
where ever-renewed flashes showed a red undulation
marked with blue spots, or streaked with
the lights of five turning beacons. We saw the
shells burst, above, below, to the right, to the
left. The cannonade seemed to slacken. Listen!
listen! A soft breeze brought us the thrilling
sounds of sharp firing, the crackling of machine-guns.
Then the hollow voice began again, and
drowned the others.</p>

<p>"Oh," Colette cried out, wringing her hands,
"to think that our brothers, our hearts' blood,
are over there! They are fighting ... they
sink to the ground ... they are wounded ... they
are dying...."</p>

<p>We trembled, we bit our lips, we said in a
murmur:</p>

<p>"If only they were going to break through, if
only they came back...."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, come!..."</p>

<p>The whole village was wide awake. Through
attic windows anxious faces were peeping; restless
people stood at their garden walls. From
house to house they exchanged impressions.</p>

<p>A young woman of the neighbourhood had
rushed to her coffee-mill at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
action, and by the time her old father went to the
garden to unearth a precious bottle of <i>marc</i>, she
had ground all her small reserve, so that "our
French" might have hot coffee on reaching the
village!</p>

<p>Alas, our hopes were once more hoped in
vain! Little by little the firing grew fainter,
the cannon less audible; the flames and the
lights died away; and suddenly silence and peace
fell upon the village. The extinguisher was
dropped on us again. Speechless and gloomy
we went to bed at two o'clock in the morning,
with limbs and souls chilled, and we did not even
try to seek sleep.</p>

<p>The civilians were not the only ones who
thought the French likely to come back. The
hussars had spent the whole night on horseback,
ready, if their brothers-in-arms withdrew, to go
at full speed to the north: such were the orders
in case of an alarm&mdash;at least they said so. Officers,
under-officers, and soldiers were all the more
grieved with the disturbance as they were going
to feast and make merry all night in order to
keep Christmas, and were looking forward to
such a junketing as they had never dreamed of
in the Marches of Brandenburg. The lieutenant
had visited all the farms of the village, felt a
hundred fowls, and chosen the plumpest and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
tenderest. The feathered tribe were waiting for
their last hour in an adjacent shed.</p>

<p>But now to whom would the inheritance
come?</p>

<p>"My beautiful fowls," the officer muttered
between his teeth, "my beautiful fowls! Who
will eat them? How many a slip is there 'twixt
the duck and the lip!"</p>

<p>The alarm over, Von Bernhausen had not yet
recovered his serenity. At break of day he
summoned his host, the farmer, the cook, and the
cook's boy, ordered them to slay, pluck, and
roast directly all that bore comb or webbed foot.</p>

<p>"At eleven," he declared, "we shall eat them
every one."</p>

<p>They ate them every one. Crammed to the
brim, greatly pleased with themselves, the hussars
strummed on their paunches: "'Tis so much
gained!"</p>

<p>There is no need to say that they began their
feast again on Christmas Day. In order to celebrate
this godly day according to old customs, soldiers
of all arms and all localities had looked everywhere
for fir-trees. They were not satisfied with
small ones, and in our wood, near Bucy, they
lopped eighteen beautiful Norway pines; they
did the like in other private estates, and even in
a public place of Laon, where the beheaded trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cut a very sorry figure, you may take my word
for it.</p>

<p>Their Christmas Eve supper was very merry,
at Morny at least, and till a late hour of the night
we heard the noise of dances, laughter, and shouts,
mingled with women's voices. We civilians
spent a poor trembling Christmas, whose bitter
sweetness was made up of fond thoughts of the
absent, and sad remembrances of past years.
Christmas ... peace on the earth ... Christmas ... all
the pleasures of our childhood recurred
to our memory.... Good-will to all
men.... Christmas, the feast of the one that
said: "Love one another." And the strong
still grind down the weak, hatred and bloodshed
prevail everywhere!... The irony of the day
brought to our lips a bitter taste.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December every one had gone to
bed as usual; the people were but slumbering as
they were now wont to, when out burst a sharp
firing accompanied by loud shouting. Every one
sprang up, all windows flew wide open, cries arose:</p>

<p>"The French!"</p>

<p>"Listen...."</p>

<p>"Hoch! hoch!"</p>

<p>Oh, despair! they were but the Prussians
cheering the New Year. Even when they enjoy
themselves, these people are not harmless. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
guns were loaded with balls, which passed through
several shutters; it was a miracle that no one
was hurt.</p>

<p>If that New Year's Day was not a merry one,
it brought with it hope that is inseparable from
everything at its beginning. Deliverance! that
was what we wished one another. And we not
only relied on the New Year to bring it, but to
bring it without great delay. Fortunately this
assurance gave us a moral satisfaction, for our
material rejoicings were very scanty. In most
houses, in ours for instance, meat did not appear
on the table any more than it had for many a day.
Only a few farmers succeeded in putting a chicken
in their pot without the knowledge of the Germans.
For it was understood that all fowls were requisitioned.
Their owners had a right to look
after them and to feed them, but not to eat them.
At the butcher's horse-meat was sold&mdash;coming
of course from animals killed at the front&mdash;and
sometimes some coarse beef, which was obtained
by large bribes from soldiers employed at the
slaughter-house. Rather than feast upon such
unappetising and expensive meat, we preferred
to eat boiled vegetables. Sometimes frogs' legs
varied the monotony of our daily menu; some
of our neighbours managed to buy venison,
poachers being not rare in the German army; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
soldiers there were who profited handsomely
from roebucks, which they killed when the officers
turned their backs.</p>

<p>But these few windfalls did not make up for
the lack of many things, hitherto looked upon
as indispensable. And what was our alarm on
hearing once that bread itself would run short!
On a certain Saturday the people who went to
fetch flour came back with their carts empty;
likewise the following week. No more bread!
This bad fortune had been long foreseen, and to
provide against it we had dried slices of bread in
the oven, and thus filled many and many a tin.
But seven persons are not long eating up a reserve
of this kind. So by a recipe, which all the village
knew, a dough was made of mashed potatoes and
a little flour&mdash;every one had managed to lay by a
few pounds of it&mdash;and these thin cakes, baked in
the oven, bore some likeness to the food we missed.</p>

<p>Other villages were even less fortunate than
ours, and had no bread at all&mdash;officially at least&mdash;for
a very long time. The farmers who had contrived
to hide corn had to grind it in a coffee-mill
or with the help of a mincing-machine, and the
ovens&mdash;long unemployed&mdash;were again turned to
account when no Germans were present.</p>

<p>On the whole our village did not starve now,
as it had starved during October and November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
A few peasants had mysteriously dug up their
potatoes, and sold them just as mysteriously.
Besides, through the Mayor's clever management,
the Germans consented to our buying from them
a certain quantity of rice, salt, and sugar. These
goods, we heard, were the remainder of provisions
sent to the commissary of stores. They
were sold on stated days, and every inhabitant
was entitled to a kilo of rice, a pound of sugar,
half a pound of salt, once a fortnight. It was a
sheer pleasure to chaffer with the invaders; they
demanded gold as payment for their scanty
revictualling, but later on they had to content
themselves with a sum partly in gold, partly in
silver. They played hang-dog tricks on the
middlemen. Once the Mayor was informed that
such and such goods were to be had to the amount
of three hundred francs. Greatly pleased, he paid
in golden cash. He was kept waiting one hour,
then two, then three. At length he was told that
he had been deceived. The provisions were not
nearly so abundant as they were first thought;
there was scarcely a hundred francs' worth. The
difference was to be given back to the purchaser.
And, indeed, two hundred francs were returned
to him, but the two hundred francs were paid in
German notes!</p>

<p>For three weeks we had no bread at all; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the Germans vouchsafed us flour of their own, so
much a day; a loaf made with this powder took
the shape of a small, flat, brown and heavy crown,
which gave us such acute pains that we often
preferred being hungry to having our fill of this
dough. We were all poor wretches and starvelings,
but we were fellow-citizens, and we arranged
to keep a certain level of the provisions. But
a hundred times more wretched and starving
were the refugees who, when their villages were
burned to the ground, had been shared among the
communes throughout the country. For months
they had neither house nor home, and about forty
of them had taken shelter in Morny, where they
were huddled in one or two empty houses, lived
but scantily, and slept on straw. Several died
during the winter. Laon was also overrun with
hundreds of those poor fugitives, and throughout
the town you were assailed and pursued by small
ragged beggars who made you think of Naples or
Marseilles. The poor things moved your pity the
more deeply as you were compelled to think:</p>

<p>"Such is perhaps the fate that is awaiting me."</p>

<p>Indeed, nobody was sure that a whim of the
Germans would not turn him out of doors. It
was seen more than once. So many things were
requisitioned. First of all, the invaders laid the
absent people under contribution, and as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
their houses had window-panes and furniture,
they were sufficient for the plunderers. But
afterwards? A large manufacturer of the
neighbourhood, M. Vergniaud, had built a castle
a few years before in the Renaissance style, and
filled it with Renaissance furniture. When the
rumour of invasion came, the owner took flight
with his household. The first soldiers quartered
in the villa knocked off the sculptures of the
cupboards with axes, while others carried away
what pleased them. We saw a china bath taken
away to the trenches; it contained two small
pigs. In the luggage of an officer who lodged
in our house there were damask curtains, plates
of old Strasburg ware, and even children's clothes,
all of which came from that castle.</p>

<p>In the end what remained of the furniture
was taken to the station, loaded upon railway
trucks, conveyed from one place to another for
a fortnight, and then sent to an unknown destination.
To Germany or to the trenches?</p>

<p>Some officers, who lived in Laon, did not approve
of the costly furniture about them, so they
sent for three civil prisoners. The orders they
gave them were simple: "Take the furniture
into the garden and break the whole in pieces
with your axes; it will serve as firewood." The
house thus cleared, these gentlemen had but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
look elsewhere for the wherewithal to furnish
their rooms.</p>

<p>If uninhabited houses contained nothing useful,
they requisitioned what they wanted from those
who had stayed at home. Von Bernhausen soon
discovered that he might find many things in
our house of which he could make a good use.
First, he was sure that such people as we are
overfed ourselves. In fact, boiled potatoes,
boiled carrots, boiled beans, boiled rice, barley
coffee, and nut-tree tea are everywhere looked
upon as choice dainties. So one day the street
was ringing with drunken shouts. We kept
silent, attentive to the least sound. "Will they
go by without worrying us?" Oh no! An
angry hand rang a full peal, whilst heavy boots
beat rhythmical imprecations upon the gate.
The key had hardly turned in the lock when
Sainte-Brute rushed in like a madman, with two
other hussars. Geneviève jumped to avoid the
shock of the man:</p>

<p>"Oh, he is drunk!"</p>

<p>These words increased the fury of the non-commissioned
officer:</p>

<p>"Drunk ... drunk ... I am drunk....
You dare say it again. It is an insult to the
German army.... You will see ... you will
see...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Geneviève, with folded arms and head erect,
as white as her woollen jacket, faced the non-commissioned
officer. She looked at him with
such an air of scorn and defiance that the maniac
broke into a new fit of rage. Bending forward,
his fists clenched, his eyes starting from their
sockets, crimson-faced, he foamed at the mouth,
he spat out: "Drunk ... you said I am
drunk ... you will go to prison ... you will
be put on bread and water ... sleep on straw
... it will serve you right ... drunk ...
drunk...."</p>

<p>Around us stood the frightened family. The
"Blackguard" sneered, and "Rabbit's Paw,"
when the madman ceased, took up the burden
of abuse. All of a sudden the sergeant altered
his mind and sprang into the cellar. His companions
followed him, and we heard them upsetting
empty bottles and shaking casks. "You
may seek for wine, my fine fellows, and if you
find a single bottle I will pour it out for you
myself."</p>

<p>In the depths of the cellar Sainte-Brute continued
to breathe forth fury, loading us with
violent and obscene insults. Fortunately we did
not understand much of his foul language. Then
he came upstairs again in haste, rushed into the
garden, and squeaked:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beans ... beans ... beans...."</p>

<p>Like one stupefied, he stopped and gazed at
the lawn as if he had expected the beans to spring
up at his call. There was no sign of them.</p>

<p>Then he turned round to me:</p>

<p>"Have you any beans?"</p>

<p>Good Heavens! There was a small sack of
big white beans which we had bought last week,
and out of which we hoped to get many a meal!
If I deny that we have any, thought I, these
people will go to the attic, and the first thing
they see is the sack of beans, white and fruitful
of promise.</p>

<p>"Hum ... yes, we have a small quantity of
beans. But as we bought them, they cannot be
requisitioned."</p>

<p>"How much have you?"</p>

<p>The answer came reluctantly:</p>

<p>"About twenty litres."</p>

<p>"Well, they are requisitioned; you are forbidden
to use them."</p>

<p>The callers were about to leave, but the
drunken man still wished to take Geneviève
away.</p>

<p>"She must go to prison ... she has insulted
the German army."</p>

<p>The "Blackguard," who was almost sober,
pulled him by the arm:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come away, come away! These people will
make a fuss, and it will be said that we are
barbarians!"</p>

<p>Sainte-Brute was loath to let himself be convinced.
At length his unsteady legs took him
off, and his acolytes followed him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Geneviève, passing her hand
over her forehead with a gesture as of madness,
"to think that all our life we have been respected,
that we have met only polite and courteous
people, and now drunken brutes may insult us
in our own house! Why, they talk of putting
us in prison, as though we were old rag-pickers
found trespassing."</p>

<p>The neighbours hastened to condole with us,
for the shouts of the soldiers had been heard a
mile off. The next intrusion came the following
day. They returned to fetch the beans. This
time they were merry in their cups, they asked
for their prey with smiles, and laying hold of it
seemed vastly amused. On leaving they burst
out laughing, and Von Bernhausen, who was
waiting for them outside, roared with merriment
as he weighed the sack of beans in his hand.</p>

<p>The Prussians are full of humour.</p>

<p>For three days running, no offensive. Then,
one morning, the Hussars announced themselves,
as usual, by shouting, kicking at the gate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ringing violently at the bell. They walked in, went
through the house, and right on to the bathroom.</p>

<p>"We want this bath."</p>

<p>It was no use protesting. The bath was taken
away. Three days after it was lying smashed
to pieces in the yard of an inn which the Hussars
frequented, and serving as a dust-bin for the
sluts of the place.</p>

<p>Then came the turn of the piano.</p>

<p>Some time before Christmas the non-commissioned
officer who had previously searched the
house presented himself very civilly:</p>

<p>"You have a piano; I want it for a few days;
we shall bring it back to you after Christmas."</p>

<p>We could not say a word. Weeks glided by;
the new year saw many dawns break; and no one
brought back the piano. This harmonious piece
of furniture was the finest ornament of a house
which the <i>garde-voies</i> had made their home.
You saw nothing but black coats there; no
Hussars, no convoys. The <i>garde-voies</i> are territorials,
elderly, sedate men, fathers of families,
whose stoutness their uniforms cannot conceal.
They smoke pipes as big as beer glasses, and
drink beer out of glasses as big as kegs. They
looked scornfully on those who stay at the farm,
whose drunkenness and rakish habits are a cause
of scandal to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore they kept aloof, searched houses,
and requisitioned goods for their own account,
had their private rejoicings, and spent their
evenings amid tobacco smoke and the smells of
beer, while they listened rapturously to patriotic
songs or even playful ditties hammered out on
our good-natured piano.</p>

<p>One day a rumour spread. The <i>garde-voies</i>
are going away. The sergeant is already off.
In fact, the non-commissioned officer had left
our parts, unmindful of the various pieces of
furniture he had "borrowed" from the inhabitants.
It was the moment to go and claim
what belonged to us. The house was about to be
cleared under the superintendence of a corporal,
who kindly authorised us to have the piano
conveyed home. He did not care for it any more;
he was going away. And the instrument was put
back into our drawing-room. It did not stay
there for a great while. That very evening Von
Bernhausen came round, greatly incensed.</p>

<p>"That piano which the <i>garde-voies</i> had? I
hear you took it away, without asking my leave!"</p>

<p>"But it is our piano. It was agreed we should
have it back."</p>

<p>"I want it; I will come for it to-morrow at
ten. You had no right to fetch it without orders
from me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Bouillot withdrew, proud of himself. The
following day he came back followed by a vehicle
and eight men chosen among the strongest of
the band. All flocked round the piano, pushing,
pulling to no purpose.</p>

<p>"I think," said my mother-in-law, "that it
would be better for the walls and for the piano
if you passed it directly into the street by the
window."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," answered the kind officer,
"you know nothing about it. The piano will go
through the passage."</p>

<p>It went through, and took with it much of the
wainscot. The Hussars made a great deal of
bustle, sweating blood and water. "Peuh!"
Yvonne whispered in my ear, "those fellows have
no muscles, they are but fat. Two years ago,
when we moved to Passy, the same piano was
carried in by a single, small, hunchbacked man.
But look at that!"</p>

<p>Bouillot acted the busybody, moved to and
fro, jested with his men, and by way of encouragement
gave them sound slaps in the small of the
back. It was easy to see that these people, or
at least their forefathers, had tended the swine
in the forests of old Germany. At last by dint
of effort the instrument was taken out of the
house, carried along the pavement, and hoisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
into the cart. The Hussars served as horses.
Gee-ho! They rushed forward, but in the courtyard
the carriage gave a start, and the piano&mdash;with
intent to commit suicide&mdash;bounded out and
fell to the ground. After a few convulsions, and
one last writhe of agony, it lay quiet.</p>

<p>"Oh! my beautiful Pleyel," cried Yvonne.</p>

<p>Some fragments of wood had been knocked
off; Bouillot picked them up:</p>

<p>"It will be easy to mend." They gave the
piano a lift, and made for the farm. All along
the street we saw it skip along in its jolting car;
the ravishers scoffingly waved their hands, and
mocked at us until they were lost sight of behind
a screen of snow.</p>

<p>Two days after a new joke of the same kind.
Bouillot and his whole gang broke in noisily:</p>

<p>"I want two chairs."</p>

<p>"All right," my mother-in-law answered, "I
will give orders for them to be brought down."</p>

<p>"No, I will choose them myself."</p>

<p>The Hussars, merry as schoolboys on a holiday,
came tumbling one over the other into the rooms,
meddled with everything, poked their noses
everywhere. Von Bernhausen went right to the
drawing-room. Those he wanted were two easy-chairs
in the style of Louis XVI.&mdash;ancient silk
is matchless for wiping filthy boots upon. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was carrying things too far. Now an officer had
installed himself in our house that very morning,
taking the place of Barbu and Crafleux. Could
we not appeal to him as a last shift?</p>

<p>Antoinette rushed forward, and knocked imperiously
at the door of the newcomer: "Sir,
sir...."</p>

<p>She was answered by a growl. Then the door
opened slightly, and a ruffled head appeared.</p>

<p>"Sir, an officer is there who wants to take our
furniture...."</p>

<p>But at that very moment Bouillot approached
in a whirlwind. He stopped short at the sight
of his brother-in-arms. The two men eyed one
another.</p>

<p>"Ah! hum! you here...."</p>

<p>They shook hands coldly. They were face to
face, the one immense, the other small; both had
the same rank, the same decoration. Our guest
had been aroused from his afternoon nap. It
was three o'clock, the right time for honest men
to sleep. His eyes were swollen, his dress untidy,
and his toes, vexed at being incorrect, wriggled
about in his socks. Yet he undertook our defence.
He did not refer, I need hardly say, to justice or
to the Conventions of the Hague. He advanced
a single argument, but it struck home.</p>

<p>"I am quartered in this house."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet this house is one of the best furnished
in the village; it is but right we should fetch
here what is wanting."</p>

<p>"... These are my quarters.... I want the
furniture that is here...."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the conference the soldiers
became serious, and one after another vanished
on tiptoe. Bernhausen at last resigned himself
and went after them. It was our turn now to
laugh at the Hussars, when we saw them go
away crestfallen, and heard their chief stammer
explanations.</p>

<p>A few days after, Lieutenant Bubenpech,
whom our roof had the honour to shelter, was
appointed commandant in place of Bouillot, by
right of seniority. Thus ended the persecution
of which we had been the victims for two months.
The guests of the farm continued their misdeeds
and their extortions, but they avoided our house,
which sheltered a power the rival of their own.
We even had the pleasure of seeing the "Blackguard"
come to our house on duty, a bashful,
blushing "Blackguard," and more than that, as
polite as a chamberlain in presence of his sovereign.</p>

<p>However, in the beginning of February, we
again had difficulties with soldiers, coming from
the trenches. Twice a week they went through
Morny with heavily laden carts. Oh, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
convoys! Monday and Thursday, as early as
four in the morning, the carts rattled through the
village, and noisily shook their empty sides on
the pavement. They stopped at the station
where there were large stores of straw, and a few
hours later went back to the front full to the
brim. The farmers took great interest in these
personages. Loads, drivers, and carts engrossed
their attention.</p>

<p>"Whatever those lazy-bones do," cried an
old peasant, "is badly done, and ought not to be
done."</p>

<p>To tell the truth, there is an art of loading
carts with straw. The first layers should be
well placed and should make a solid foundation
according to time-honoured rules. The Prussians'
loads always stood awry, and threatened ruin
as soon as they were erected. First one bundle
tumbled over, a second followed, then at a turn
of the road the whole pyramid sank to the
ground, hurling the listless drivers headlong into
a ditch. Nearly every time they came to fetch
straw the loaders managed to let it fall, and we
watched them rebuild carelessly another tottering
heap, Of course these men were thirsty after
their hard toil, and they stopped at every fountain
to refresh ... their horses; as to themselves
they drank anything but water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is, then, the way fifteen soldiers happened
to come to our house to draw water from our
pump. Many buckets had been pulled up, and
the men did not go. They went up and down,
laughed, opened one door, then another, ventured
into the garden, peeped in at the windows.
Geneviève went to encounter them.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. We are pleased to stay here
because there are pretty girls in the house,"
answered the sergeant in very good French.</p>

<p>"Then, if there is no need for you to stay
here, you had better go away; I want to lock the
gate, we never keep it open."</p>

<p>And the men withdrew. Colette, who watched
the scene from upstairs, said afterwards:</p>

<p>"It was very funny! You'd have thought
that our sister was driving these fifteen big louts
before her."</p>

<p>No sooner were they in the street than the
Germans gazed at one another. Did it not look
as if they had been kicked out of doors!</p>

<p>"Hullo! we are not people to be trifled with!"</p>

<p>They soon gave proofs of it. Suddenly
they flung themselves upon the windows, doors,
walls. We were forced to give way, and my
mother-in-law opened the gate. This compliance
with their wishes did not abate the assailants'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
anger. They rushed into the yard, and poured
forth worse volleys of abuse than ever an Apache
of Montmartre could invent.</p>

<p>"Ah," cried the sergeant, grinding his teeth
in anger, "you are not tamed down here; you
do not know what the Germans are! Come to
Lierval; you will see there how the people have
been curbed. They don't say anything now....
They hold their tongues, I warrant you...."</p>

<p>One of his men drew the moral of this discourse
by aiming his gun at us. "Franzouss ... all
shot."</p>

<p>They stayed two hours, strolling about the
yard, muttering insults between their teeth. To
complete our misfortune, the convoy spent the
night in Morny. The men came back in the
evening, and the commandant being away they
made the most fearful row we had ever heard,
from nine to eleven, and yet the Hussars were not
bad at rough music.</p>

<p>They were not bad at many other jobs. They
were acknowledged the most skilful hunters of
hiding-places, and Sainte-Brute, with his acolytes,
spent many a day in wandering through fields
and gardens. They sought for holes that might
conceal potatoes, corn, or&mdash;generally near to the
houses&mdash;wine which they were so fond of. The
Conventions of the Hague, it would seem, allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the invaders of a country to requisition wine, for
the use of the "wounded"; so when the soldiers
emptied a cellar or discovered a <i>cache</i> they
declared with gravity that it was all for the Red
Cross. I suppose the Germans bear a likeness
to zoophytes, what one of them absorbs is profitable
to the others, and when wine had been
unearthed "for the wounded" the whole pack
were drunk for days together. And these creatures
took all&mdash;all. They destroyed systematically
what they could not take away. After having
despoiled us of our money, they seized corn, straw,
vegetables, wine, milk, eggs. Poultry, cows,
oxen, the very horses which the peasants had
bought of them in a bad condition, and taken
good care of, belonged to them, and they alone
were entitled to dispose of them. All that was on
the earth and beneath the earth, all that was
growing and living&mdash;including the people&mdash;were
their own property. They carried off the very
paving-stones heaped up on the wayside to repair
the roads. If they stay long enough they will
carry away, cart after cart, the rich, fat earth of
our soil, to spread over and fertilise the barren
ground of Prussia. If they could find a means,
with the help of their alchemists who have made
a pact with the devil, they would take away our
deep-blue sky in panels; they would drag along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
our bracing and mild air to purify the mists of
the north.</p>

<p>As they cannot&mdash;despite their bargain with
the devil&mdash;perform such feats of skill, they wreak
revenge on us by spoiling our beautiful country.
Our farmers were furious when they saw the
Germans&mdash;the first winter after their arrival&mdash;plough
up fields throughout the land, unmindful
of the limits and value of the soil. And what
splendid tillage was theirs! Their laziness turned
up about ten centimetres of earth; they sowed
seed, and put no manure; before they leave they
want to exhaust the soil of which they are jealous,
and which they would like to annihilate. They
cut down nut trees to make butt-ends of guns,
and fruit trees to amuse themselves.</p>

<p>In the forests they committed downright
murder. Where it is worth while they cut down
trees of reasonable growth at regular intervals;
anywhere else they break off saplings about one
yard from the ground. In the wood of Festieux
I know an immense beech-tree. Its trunk can
hardly be encircled by four men with outstretched
arms. In its boughs a nobleman of the neighbourhood
lived for several weeks at the time of
the Revolution. As they found no means to fell
this giant, the invaders have hewn pieces out of
it all round, and cut off its upper branches. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
poor tree will not outlive the invasion. On the
outskirts of the villages, along the roads and
brooks, the Germans cut down the beautiful trees,
poplars, maples, chestnuts, which gave a poetical
charm to the country. To spoil the land is the
aim of our malignant foe. Truly, it will be long
before songs and laughter are heard again in the
wasted country. The nymphs of our groves
seek in vain their verdant shades along the treeless
rivulets, and flee away, sighing their elegies.
Can anything be sadder than this? No epic
could be more tragical, no ode could exalt our
hearts more than this call, more than this immense
wailing we are ever hearing. It is the very

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Herr Bubenpech had hardly been appointed
commandant in Morny when the enemy took a
new step in the organisation of the country. From
that moment two or three spectacled scribes
gathered together in a large schoolroom, labelled
"Bureau" both in French and in German, and
busied themselves with endless scribblings. They
drew up lists of the male inhabitants of the village,
who twice a month had to be present when their
names were called over. They put in writing
all the divers tasks required of the villagers.
They kept an account of the allowance of food
sometimes granted to the civilians. They distributed
passports and they superintended requisitions.
From the outset Bubenpech seemed
eager to show he was hard to please. The rural
constable was ordered to announce that gold was
to be brought to the "bureau," where the owners
would be given bank-notes in its stead, according
to the simplest exchange, 100 marks for 125 francs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Pieces of gold are not readily drawn out of
the stockings. Yet a few of them had to come
forth. I am afraid that since then the invaders
have managed to empty them; but at that time
they were only at the heel.</p>

<p>By mere chance Morny had as yet paid no
more than the contribution of war which had been
levied on the whole country soon after the invasion.
Other villages less fortunate than ours had been
overburdened with taxes upon the most ridiculous
pretences. A poor hamlet, Coucy les Eppes, was
fined six times during the space of a few months.
First came the general contribution. Then a
fine of half a million francs was imposed upon the
canton of Sissonne, to which Coucy belongs, and
every village had to pay its share. It so happened
that in September some soldiers, coming
back from Reims, drove their carts through
Sissonne, and as their carts were loaded with
bottles of wine, they drank all the way, and threw
empty bottles behind them. Then came motor-cars,
which punctured their tyres on the broken
glass. Great scandal! The civilians were
accused of having put a trap for honest Prussian
wheels. Their protestations availed nothing.
The canton was condemned to a fine; the canton
must pay; and Coucy paid like the other communes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>When all houses were searched after the great
proclamation of November, an old flint-lock,
kept in memory of an ancestor, was discovered in
Coucy at an old maiden lady's. It never struck
the owner that she should have brought it to
the Mayor's house, or hidden it. And suppose
the old maiden lady had shouldered the ancient
gun? It is enough to make you shudder when
you think of the danger the German army might
have thus incurred. As quick as could be a few
thousand francs were levied on the village which
dared be subversive enough to conceal an old
maid and an old gun. Even then the troubles
of the poor village did not come to an end. A
French aviator dropped a bomb on the station,
and the bomb disturbed a few German carriages.
The military authority knitted its brows.</p>

<p>"Why! This Coucy is talked of again!
Let it have a good fine, and it will keep quiet."</p>

<p>For what reasons had this village to bleed
itself and borrow from the town in order to pay
the invader twice more, I do not know, but so it
was. Morny's turn was coming. One night a
barn of the farm where the Hussars were
quartered took fire, and was soon in a blaze with
the straw it contained. The whole village ran
to quench the conflagration. We stood near-by
just long enough to see the peasants put the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
out with all speed, while the soldiers folded their
arms, and were pleased to be amused. Von
Bernhausen and Bubenpech looked on at the
spectacle. Then Von Bernhausen thought proper
to rate the Mayor sharply:</p>

<p>"There are not people enough.... Go and
fetch civilians.... Be quick...."</p>

<p>All the able-bodied men of the village were
summoned, and they sweated while the Hussars
made sport of them. The <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i>,
which took the place of the <i>Journal de Guerre</i> to
the very best advantage, does not relate such
accidents in this wise, but I can only narrate
what my eyes have seen.</p>

<p>Bubenpech rubbed his hands. He had found
an opportunity to show his zeal. With all speed
he sent a report to the Staff, upon which he depended,
stating that civilians had set the barn
on fire out of spite. He forgot to add that a few
hours before the disaster the Hussars had burnt
their dirty, lousy mattresses in the neighbourhood
of the said barn, where, besides, soldiers had
been seen smoking many a time with perfect
serenity.</p>

<p>So stout gentlemen in full uniform came to
Morny, and with reproachful looks stalked majestically
through the streets. A chance was given
us to atone for the misdeed. If within twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
hours information was lodged against the
civilian who had set fire to the barn, the village
might be forgiven. Should the contrary happen,
a severe penalty would be immediately enforced.
No denunciation, and for good reasons. The
people were convinced that the soldiers had
kindled the straw on purpose. The military
authorities, grieved to the heart, imprisoned,
without further delay, the Mayor and six notable
persons. Then they deliberated upon the matter,
and always regretfully imposed a fine of 16,000
francs on the village. They ordered the other
prisoners to be set at liberty after three days,
but kept the Mayor under lock and key for two
weeks, ill fed and worse lodged. M. Lonet and
another municipal councillor went the round of
the village, and did their best to get the sum
required. They managed to collect 12,000 francs,
and the Germans had to be content with that for
the present. They knew only too well that they
would catch us again.</p>

<p>Besides other cares worried us. In February
1915 our houses were again searched from top
to bottom. It was proclaimed that the inhabitants
should declare the quantity of corn, flour, and
vegetables they had in store, so that the provisions
might be requisitioned according to the needs of
the German army. And mysterious sacks, closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
baskets, furtive barrows were seen in Morny.
There was an air of haste; men passed close to
the walls, went along out-of-the-way paths, up to
attics, down into holes. When the day of perquisition
came&mdash;the Germans believed their own
eyes rather than the declarations of the natives&mdash;there
were tears and gnashing of teeth. Treasures
were discovered, potatoes and corn dug up. The
Germans laid hold of everything; they even
despoiled the very poor of their slender provisions.
For instance, our neighbours, the Branchiers, a
very young couple, whose joint ages were less
than forty years, who had only an empty purse
and about thirty kilos of potatoes, were robbed
to the very last shred.</p>

<p>That they might not lose a single potato they
carefully raked Mme. Turgau's shed all around,
and seized forty, though the poor woman has four
children, who do not live upon nothing. We, in
our house, tired of the war, hid nothing at all.
We had possessed for a fortnight four sacks of
wheat, which we had bought from a farmer, who
had mysteriously sold this secret hoard. Where,
I beg of you, could you conceal four sacks of
wheat in an honest house? Especially when
you know from sad experience that the perquisitioners
perform their office conscientiously.
At Aulnois they had watered a cellar to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
sure that the ground had not been newly dug.
At Vaux they had not left twenty centimetres of
a certain garden unexplored. After a long debate
we decided to leave things as they were.</p>

<p>But if peace returns and I am able to build a
house, it shall have hiding-places, wells, tanks,
deep dungeons! Hollow walls shall open by
means of secret springs, and two, three, five cellars
shall be arrayed one beneath the other, which, in
case of need, shall swallow up whole herds, to
say nothing of a vast reserve of groceries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our goods being full in sight,
Bubenpech, who, out of politeness, gave himself
the trouble to search our house, visiting every
cupboard and poking his nose everywhere,
had been at no pains to discover them. He declared
he was compelled to requisition the corn,
but with a smile he left us our potatoes. Colette
was indignant.</p>

<p>"Why! this fellow does not take our potatoes
because he wants to be amiable! And our neighbours
have been despoiled of everything! It is
a shame! We must share with the others."</p>

<p>And we did.</p>

<p>A basket to right, a basket to left, a basket
over the way, our provision well-nigh dwindled to
nothing. After that we were in the same state
as our neighbours. It is beyond doubt that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
people had managed to save many things, and of
course the Germans had surmised as much. Two
or three days after the first perquisitions they
dropped in unawares, and made very profitable
visits. Mme. Turgau, for instance, had succeeded
in hiding a sack of wheat, and the soldiers were
hardly out of the way when she baked a loaf to
celebrate her good fortune. The loaf, yellow and
round, was displayed on the table, while on the
ground lay the sack, saved from the wreck, and
little Lucienne, a slender girl of twelve, as reasonable
as a woman, was grinding corn in a coffee-mill.
Near at hand a dish was already full of
flour; after a second operation of the same kind
it would be fit for kneading. The mother was
out, the baby girl, Claire, was busy sucking her
thumb, with her admiring gaze on her sister;
the last-born was asleep in its cradle.</p>

<p>Heavy steps broke the silence, big shadows
appeared on the door-sill. "The Prussians!"</p>

<p>The coffee-mill stopped short.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" the non-commissioned officer
said, "you have corn; you stole it."</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is just a little bit I have gleaned
with mamma."</p>

<p>"You stole it," replied the soldier. "Don't
you know that everything belongs to the Germans?
If you have corn you must have stolen it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>And the perquisitioners carried away in
triumph the small sack, the beautiful golden loaf,
and even the dishful of half-ground flour. On
coming back, Mme. Turgau found Lucienne in
tears, Claire weeping in imitation of her sister,
and Jacquot, ever ready to make an uproar,
screaming at the top of his voice. After these
fatal visits we had still more holes to take in in our
belts. Nothing was ever left on our table. The
dishes, few in number, were immediately divided
into seven parts, and every one thought when
rising from table: "I could begin again with
pleasure."</p>

<p>The question of light was another plague of
our life. The last drop of petroleum, the last
traces of linseed oil had been converted into
smoke a long time before. We were obliged to
use horse-oil like our neighbours.</p>

<p>Horse-oil! Oh! for ever and ever nauseous
remembrance! Always half-congealed, brownish,
sticky, stinking, it made its bold manipulators
sick for an hour.</p>

<p>This oil was manufactured by a man in the
village when he could procure a dead horse, not
too lean; and as we could not get as much as
we had wished, we had to be sparing of it. The
villagers simply poured it into an old sardine
box, and the wick, leaning against the metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
brim, smoked, charred, smelt nasty, and gave as
little light as possible.</p>

<p>In spite of our efforts, this half-liquid matter
energetically refused to ascend in the lamp; and
we were forced to let it burn openly in a receptacle
of some kind or other, and to support it by an ingenious
system of pins. In fact it was so ingenious
that the wick was swamped in the oil every moment,
and we were left groping about the dark room,
whose air was infected with a smell of burnt flesh.
Doleful evenings, still more doleful nights. We
no longer slept as we had slept before the Hussars'
serenades. In order to give a larger apartment
to Bubenpech, Geneviève and I had to be satisfied
with the "small room" which is on a level with
the yard and icy cold in winter. A simple rush-mat
covered the pavement; the stove was small,
the fuel rare, our blanket thin&mdash;the Hussars had
requisitioned two others. We went to bed
shivering with cold; our hot-water bottle alone
gave us a little life. As to sleep.... One does
not sleep much in an invaded country; every
moment some unwonted noise makes you start;
and then the rumbling of the cannon disturbs
you, and the thought of the absent sends a thrill
through your heart.</p>

<p>And then you ask yourself: How long? how
long? In February 1915 the end seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
have been postponed. "Our soldiers will come
back next spring," said the peasants. Resigned
to fate, we all waited for their return, and long
were the nights. I know people who went to bed
at five o'clock, without a dinner, for good reasons,
and got up at about eight o'clock. How many
pangs and cares thus wandered in the darkness!
Geneviève and I dreaded the shades of evening,
and it was often midnight before we made up our
minds to blow out the light. Many a nightmare
startled us, keeping us wide awake for the rest
of the night. Who shall describe the horror of
the dreams dreamed during the war? The dreams
of the conquered! Every night brought its own
vision, but two came back with a most distressing
obstinacy.</p>

<p>A landscape covered with snow, a great deal
of snow, round-topped mountains, the wind
tossing the branches of the fir-trees. It looks
like the Vosges. Why? Posy, are you in the
Vosges? How can the wind make such a noise
through the branches? I see but one fir tree
black against the gloomy sky. And I hear it
thunder, yet the thunder never roars in winter.
I see a crow whirling round and round before
it alights. There is nothing under the fir tree.
But I know something must be there. Here it
is, it is black ... it is long. The crow hovers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
I do not stir, my feet are sunk in the snow. Yet
I come nearer, or rather the thing is approaching.
Yet it is exactly what I thought; it is a dead
body. Its uniform is untouched. Its face ...
the eye-sockets are empty. Who is it? who is it?
The crow has torn out his eyes! Yet we buried
the scout in Chevregny. Who is it? Oh, God!
he that is nearest to me in the world!</p>

<p>Posy!...</p>

<p>I shrieked with terror and I awoke, panting.
The wind moaned through the trees of the garden,
and from time to time ceased as if to allow its
raging interlocutor, the cannon, to roar instead of
itself.</p>

<p>It was impossible to try to sleep again. But
we also used to dream wide awake. In the
invaded country thousands and thousands of
people are thus thinking in the dark. Their
hands are clasped in prayer, or clenched, or convulsively
pressed, or relaxed out of utter weariness.
It is the hour when the absent are present. What
family has not one or several members at the
front? And for many months an abyss has
grown between us which cannot be crossed.
But at night they come back; in the dark we
see the dear faces smile; we watch their familiar
gestures, we hear their familiar voices. Shall we
be allowed to see them again here below? Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
are they? where are the strong arms that embraced
me when I murmured, "Posy, I am
cold."</p>

<p>Where are the beloved ones? The mothers
are at prayers, the mothers are crying; sisters,
wives, all that love shrink with horror at the
sights that pass before their eyes. Where are
the beloved ones? They have been dead perhaps
these last six months. Their bodies may be
rotting among barbed wire; they may have
been blown to pieces by an explosion, or swollen
by asphyxiating gas, or burnt in the flames, or
crushed beneath earthworks, or riddled by grape-shot,
or torn by balls. Their bodies which have
been cherished, cared for, kissed! And we go
on hoping for them, thinking them alive, safe and
sound. When shall we know whether they are
dead or alive, whether strong and healthy or
moaning upon a bed in hospital?</p>

<p>Our souls, our eager hearts are longing for
delivery, and the day it comes will perhaps bring
with it the bitterest sorrows. Most families will
have to mourn a dead one; the whole country
will be sunk in grief: Rachel weeping for her
children and refusing to be comforted. We shall
be despoiled and stripped of everything; we live
but for the hope of meeting again our loved ones,
and how many will never come back! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
while they die, we receive their murderers!
They sleep under our roofs, eat the fruits of our
labour, and reign over us.</p>

<p>The want of news, the presence of the Germans,
such were the saddest things of our life. Oh,
they were present, always present! It was impossible
to forget them even for one moment.
They pursued us in our dreams, they haunted
us. How often I have found myself stretched
on a road, on an icy cold road in a barren country.
And men came galloping up with loud shouting,
and I could not move, the cavalcade was going
to crush me:</p>

<p>The Hussars! the Hussars!...</p>

<p>Once more I set up a cry; I woke up. Steps,
voices resounded in the street. The officers'
evening party was at an end. The key fumbled
at the lock; Bubenpech was coming back. It
was one o'clock, or two, or three. I heard the
dogs patter along the yard, they wanted to
identify the visitor. The cannon rumbled with
a sluggish sound. The hours were slow, slow.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Antoinette often said charitably:</p>

<p>"Just mind what I say, mother, one morning
you will see the whole of us come up singing,
dancing, laughing, perfectly fit for Bedlam."</p>

<p>To be sure one would go mad for less. Our
life was duller than any one's: fancy six women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
shut up in a house, having nothing particular to
do, always engrossed by the same tiring thoughts.
Leisure is an evil very difficult to bear in an
invaded territory. You wait; you do nothing
else; you seem to be in a condition that cannot
go on for long. Work? To what purpose?
For whose sake? And what work to do? Save
the men whom the Germans have requisitioned,
and who, of course, tire themselves as little as
possible, every one drags out his days. The
baker, the teachers, and the cobbler are the only
persons of the village really busy. We envied
them their occupations, as we had but our needles
to fill up our free hours. Very soon we had darned
our old clothes, set them to rights, and distributed
them among the poor. There was a family of
seven children, whose mother had just died, and
whose clothes we kept in decent condition. But
it was not enough. We, too, yawned our life away.</p>

<p>Ten times a day we cried aloud for the means
of escape! Escape! To live again an active
life, to see people who are not Germans, to know
what is going on, to live!</p>

<p>A gleam of hope came: it was in the month
of March, the garden was already strewn with
snowdrops, primroses, and crocuses. Captivity
was harder to bear than ever. One day the
rural constable made an announcement. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
appeared to our eyes crowned with a golden
nimbus, and more dazzling than an archangel;
his voice was sweeter than honey. He said:</p>

<p>"The persons who want to leave the invaded
territory to go into other parts of France may
have their names put down at the townhall with
the exception of the men from fourteen to sixty."</p>

<p>This caused so great an emotion among us
that we well-nigh quitted this life suddenly and
simultaneously. We kept on the look-out for
Bubenpech, when he should come home, to
demand further particulars.</p>

<p>This Bubenpech did not please us at all. It
is agreed that no Prussian could have pleased us.
But on the dislike we entertain to the whole race
was grafted a personal aversion to him. He was
dark-haired, middle-sized, short-legged, with a
solid torso, topped by a big neckless head. He had
regular features, deceitful eyes, and looked something
of a rake. He was said to be nearly related
to a general, and he thought himself irresistible.</p>

<p>"How dissipated he looks," we said the first
time we saw him.</p>

<p>And one of his soldiers whispered in Mme.
Lantois' ear:</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, not bad! ... but many women,
many women. That's not good!"</p>

<p>In fact Bubenpech led a most dissolute life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
He soon brought confusion upon Morny, and his
stay there was the commencement of a debauch
that caused a scandal throughout the region.</p>

<p>With us he was at first all smiles. But our
looks soon chilled him, and he was content with
a short bow when he happened to meet one of us,
which was rare, for we carefully avoided him.</p>

<p>"At least," we said, "he is not too dull-witted;
he understands that we look sour at the Germans,
and he does not want to have us punished for it."</p>

<p>We were candid. Bubenpech was not rude and
unmannerly like Von Bernhausen, and therefore
his methods were different.</p>

<p>All the same he bore us a grudge for having
been insensible to his charms; only he looked
upon revenge as a cold dish. But he swore that
we should pay dearly for the scorn of the Germans,
and he waited his opportunity. He was sure to
seize it, even if it limped with a lame foot.</p>

<p>For the present, he encouraged us to go, and
gave most comforting particulars about the
journey, which would be an easy one. The trains
would take thousands of people to Switzerland,
and within four or five days at the farthest we
should be in Paris. Would we go, indeed!
Rather than stay behind we would have made
the journey in a cattle-truck, upon our head, or
on our knees. Five days to go to Paris, what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that! Even were we to spend them sleepless,
even were we to starve, and be squeezed tight
like sardines in a tin box!</p>

<p>"Who will go?" I inquired. There were
some who held back.</p>

<p>"I stay here," declared Mme. Valaine. "Up
to now the house has not been plundered; I want
to keep it as it is."</p>

<p>"I stay here," said Colette in her turn. "Do
you think I will fly before the Prussians again?
Besides, I have nothing to do in Paris. I will
keep mother company. I saw the French go
away; I want to see them come back."</p>

<p>"Then," Yvonne decided, "I will stay too.
Shall I go and study music in Paris when the
Prussians are still here? Never. Since mother
and Colette remain, I stay with them. After all,
the French can't be long in coming back."</p>

<p>Mother and daughters insisted.</p>

<p>"Besides," they added, "living will be easier
when you are away. If Mme. Lantois manages
to give us one or two eggs or a bottle of milk,
this windfall will not have to be divided into seven
parts. For us, all that is left of our potatoes!
For us, the provision of macaroni that is
hidden in the canopy of the bed of 'our
Prussian.'"</p>

<p>After a long discussion the thing was settled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
We fell into one another's arms. Every one of
us shed a flood of tears, and with feverish haste
we made preparations for our departure.</p>

<p>At the idea that he was going to see his mother
again Pierrot had turned as white as a sheet, and
then had begun screaming at the top of his voice,
"Mother! mother! mother!" He jumped, he
danced. We had to tell him that if he were so
tiresome we should be obliged to leave him in
Morny, and he became as quiet as a lamb.</p>

<p>Our bags were soon packed, and with thrilling
hearts we awaited our departure.</p>

<p>The announcement of the journey did not
arouse the enthusiasm which the Germans had
expected. Bubenpech had given us a grand and
imposing picture of those evacuations <i>en masse</i>.</p>

<p>"We purpose," he said, "we purpose evacuating
forty per cent of the civil population. Why
should we go on feeding so many useless people?</p>

<p>"We shall but keep back," he went on, "large
landowners and the workers we are in need of.
At the end of the month, a train will start every
day; volunteers will first go, then the necessitous."</p>

<p>The number of volunteers were very small.
The people reposed no trust at all in the Prussians.</p>

<p>"Do you think," the women of the village
whispered, "that they are going to take you to
France? To a concentration camp rather. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
may take my word for it. Some people have
thus left Chauny, and now they are somewhere
in the north ... out in the open country ... up
to the knees in the mud...."</p>

<p>We laughed at them.</p>

<p>"But why should the Germans take charge of
us? They would be obliged to feed us no matter
how little they gave us."</p>

<p>It was all of no use. Nobody was willing to
go, not even those who eagerly wished to escape.</p>

<p>The organisers of the convoys were amazed.
They determined that certain persons should go
by foul means since they would not go by fair
means. The commandant of every village was
ordered to eject so many persons. The number
for Morny was fixed at twenty. There were two
volunteers besides ourselves, an elderly lady,
Mme. Charvon, and her granddaughter; both
wanted to go back to Paris. Thirteen reluctant
emigrants were then to be picked up among the
people. Bubenpech chose at random a woman
from Braye, her five small children, and her old
father, then three orphan boys, and a family
including an invalid father, a mother, and two
little girls.</p>

<p>These had two sons, sixteen and eighteen
years old, who would stay behind if the parents
went. They raised an outcry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"My poor boys!" the mother moaned; "am
I going to abandon them like that? We beg
nothing of the Germans! We want only to be
left together."</p>

<p>She went to the "bureau," threw herself at
the feet of Bubenpech, who scouted her demand
with disdain, and had her kicked out of doors.
The morning we were to start she pretended to
be ill, and kept to her bed. The lieutenant
despatched four men who took her out of bed,
heedless of her resistance, and made her get into
the cart, with a blanket as sole wrapper. We
heard the poor woman sob while she put on her
stays and petticoats in the jolting cart that took
us to Laon. And the folly of it was that another
woman of Cerny wished for nothing better than
to go.</p>

<p>"Since my sister and father are sent away,"
she said, "I choose rather to go with them; I
have no mind to stay here alone with my two
babies."</p>

<p>It was not to be. Three persons eager to
stay were forced to go; three others, nothing
loath to go, were bidden to stay. Thus had our
leaders settled the matter.</p>

<p>In other villages it was still worse. A man
of Barenton set his house on fire and hanged
himself rather than leave. Some persons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sent away because the Germans coveted their
houses for one purpose or another. At Vivaise
the wife of an adjutant was compelled to leave
her well-furnished house for the reason that it
pleased those gentlemen. So a blind woman and
her invalid husband, both aged seventy-five,
were banished from Verneuil. In tears they left
their small house where they had lived happily
for many a year, their garden, whose fruits were
sufficient for their scanty needs. Besides, they
had a few fowls and a little money, and so they
were not in the least a charge upon the Germans.
Of course they expected everything to be plundered
and destroyed, and, weak and old as they were,
they saw no hope that they would ever come
back.</p>

<p>We were volunteers, at one moment distressed
at the thought that we left three of our own
people in the lurch, at another mad with joy
that we should soon be at liberty, or trembling
with fear lest we should hear bad news of those
whose fate was hidden from us.</p>

<p>About the end of March, after many tears
had been shed, embraces and kisses exchanged,
after the very dogs had been hugged, we found
ourselves in front of the "bureau" with the
other departing travellers. We all got into two
big carts, and sat down on our luggage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
departures were somewhat delayed. We had
to wait for the woman who did not want to go
away.</p>

<p>At ten the carts set out.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, we shall see you later in Paris,"
Bubenpech cried.</p>

<p>It was the parting kick of the ass.</p>

<p>"Then you will come as a prisoner," replied
Antoinette, laying aside all prudence. The
officer broke out laughing and turned a deaf ear.
With a great deal of jolting, the carts took us
away, and we soon lost sight of the pale faces of
Mme. Valaine and her daughters. Two gendarmes
on horseback accompanied us. Thus we were
enrolled among the emigrants. We alighted
in Laon, and were shown into a huge hall
adjoining the station. The little emigrants of
Cerny were still screaming, the refractory woman
had not left off crying. Pierrot felt uneasy, and
hung on my arm; we dragged our luggage along
with a great deal of trouble. The hall we were
taken to was already crowded with hundreds of
persons. From early morning the refugees had
been arriving in great numbers. Long rough
boards nailed upon four upright pieces of wood
served as tables and benches. Besides the
picture of the emperor the walls were chiefly
decorated with vast inscriptions. "God with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
us" was not absent; nor was "God punish
England," in letters three feet high. The shrieking
of the urchins, their mothers' scolding overtopped
the general noise. The old people looked
scared, and did not know what to do. On the
rough tables soldiers put platters of a sticky,
greyish soup; a smell of burnt grease floated in
the air. We were waiting for our turn to go
to a small room where three nurses of the Red
Cross were busy feeling, searching, undressing the
emigrants as they pleased.</p>

<p>"No papers, no letters?"</p>

<p>At two every one had filed off before these
searchers, and we were ordered to start again.
So through the streets of Vaux the pitiful crowd
wended its way to the station, about twelve
hundred emigrants surrounded by soldiers. From
their thresholds the inhabitants stared at us.
Truly a more miserable herd never was seen.
The Germans had chosen to send away the
poorest among the poor of our villages&mdash;bareheaded
women, ragged children, beggarly men,
sick people, cripples, idiots. All were laden and
overladen with parcels, baskets, and bundles.
There were two or three carts to convey the
heaviest luggage, but every one preferred keeping
what was dearest to him.</p>

<p>We, too, were overladen. We made what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
haste we could among the grey crowd. We had
walked a mile, I could hardly carry my bag any
longer. At one moment it even dropped from
my hands. I approached an officer, stiff and
stout, who seemed to be the manager of the
caravan.</p>

<p>"Sir," I besought, "please order a moment's
rest.... I can't go any farther."</p>

<p>"No, no, no halt. If you can't carry your
things, ask some one else."</p>

<p>Some one else! That was easy to say. I
looked around me despairingly; the people were
all as weary as I.</p>

<p>Pierrot stuck to my arm, Antoinette was
somewhere in front, Geneviève was spent with
fatigue. Near us a soldier seemed touched with
pity.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I can't help you, but it is forbidden."</p>

<p>At length I caught sight of a big fellow who
carried his fortune in a handkerchief. He was one-eyed,
one-armed, but he was willing to take charge
of my bag. I was then able to help Geneviève
with hers. We were saved, we stopped every
other minute, put down our common load, and
taking it up again ran forward to fall into place.</p>

<p>Where were we going to? We went on,
tramping through the mud, with the noise of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
flock of sheep, and, to crown all, there came on a
heavy rain, which the poor crying children received
on their dirty little noses. We had left the
suburbs, and the road now passed through the
open country. At about three miles from the
station we perceived an immense train of third-class
carriages that was waiting for us. It was
carried by storm. Each one settled himself.
We were but six persons in one carriage, we and
two ladies of Morny, the grandmother and the
granddaughter.</p>

<p>We exchanged congratulations. We had been
told that the journey might be difficult: one of
the hardest stages was passed. We sat down to
recover our breath, stretched our stiff limbs, and
then looked around us. The carriages we were
in had been used to convey troops; they were
bedecked with inscriptions in pencil. Some
without much expense of thought merely wished
that "God should punish England!" Others
clamoured for "the death to those pigs of Frenchmen!"
Or stated that "French blood is good."
Pierrot conscientiously rubbed out with his handkerchief
as much as he could. After many
man&oelig;uvres, marches, and counter-marches the
train decided to start. It was about four o'clock.
Oh, memorable hour! We saw the gate of our
prison open a little! Was it possible that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
were going away? Was it true? Could we say
in our turn, "within four days, Parisse!"</p>

<p>We were made with joy; we kissed one
another; then we thought it wise to put our
things in order. This carriage would doubtless
serve us as a shelter as far as the Swiss frontier,
perhaps for two or three days. The first thing,
then, was to make ourselves comfortable. Our
feet were cold. Suppose we put on our slippers?
No sooner said than done.</p>

<p>When our first joy had somewhat cooled down,
and we were properly installed, we watched the
landscape. The train went slowly through a
dull country; the clouds seemed to crawl along
the ground, and the mist moistened the panes
of the windows. We had hardly gone an hour
when the train stopped, and left half of its
carriages in the station. Then we resumed our
journey, and soon made a second halt. We could
not read the name of the station we were at; we
did not know even what line we were on. The
engine was reversed, then stopped some time after
with a loud whistle.</p>

<p>Soldiers went along the carriages and threw
the doors open.</p>

<p>"Get down, all, bags and baggage."</p>

<p>Sudden change! In great haste we put on
our shoes, tied our shawls and cloaks together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
gathered our bags, and jumped out on the line.
Many cries and calls were heard. At last the
train emptied itself; there was a whistle, and off
it moved. There we were, about six hundred of us
standing on a steep bank, and wondering what was
going to happen next. No station was to be seen,
the country seemed deserted, pasture-land on the
left, hills stripped by the winter on the right.
The emigrants, uneasy in their minds, bustled
about; women fell a-weeping; relations sought
one another; an old man bent with age, and
walking awry like a crab, moved to and fro.
"My wife, I have lost my wife." Thus he
moaned to himself, looking for the weak arm
that would hold up his greater debility.</p>

<p>The babies cried with cold. A sharp wind
pierced us to the marrow, the rain cut our faces,
and our hearts thrilled with fear, while the night
fell on the anxiety of the miserable herd moving
in the fog.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Under the bridge of the railway was a high-road.
The soldiers directed the crowd towards it. "Get
down, get down," they cried, gesticulating all the
while. Narrow steps had been cut in the dark
slippery ground. The bank was very steep, yet
every one ventured down; the young people
held the old ones; the nimblest carried luggage
and infants; the children tumbled forwards
upon all fours. On getting to the road we saw
a few carts waiting for bags and bundles. We
abandoned ours into the hands of the soldiers.
Happen what might to our things, our courage
failed us to take charge of them again. Who
knew how many miles we were to walk?</p>

<p>"Go on, go on," our guardians cried.</p>

<p>And the sorry band, so much the more lamentable
as they were drenched to the skin, bent their
bodies, and trudged off again. "What does this
unexpected halt mean?" we asked one another
with a mixture of curiosity and dismay. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
road with hedges on each side, after we had met
with a bridge and a crossing, took us to a village.
Standing in front of their houses, the people,
moved with pity, watched our beggarly crowd go
by in the twilight, dabbling in the mud, and not
knowing where they were being taken to. We did
not even know the place we were in. The name
we read on a finger-post did not say anything
to us. At the top of the street two gendarmes
on horseback divided the herd into two parts, so
many heads to the right, so many to the left.
We were pushed on to the right, we went to the
right. We had left the village, and went down
a road bordered with high trees that led into the
open country.</p>

<p>"They were right all the same, those who said
we would be landed in the fields," moaned a
woman. Then we took a short cut between two
banks. We were all over mud. At length, on
the slope of the hill, we caught sight of a dark
mass, a very large farm with vast outhouses.
We had reached the goal. The lower windows
glimmered; a few guards were seen in a room
of the ground floor. We entered the kitchen,
where whole beams blazed on the hearth. The
soldiers bustled about. It was no light matter
to settle in a short time&mdash;350 persons crowded
in together in the courtyard. And they hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
over the job: so many emigrants in the house,
in the barns, in the stables, in the attics.</p>

<p>"Straw is to be had everywhere; do as you
can."</p>

<p>The people did as they could. Moving about
kept them warm; it was their only means.
We were among the privileged; we had been
presented with a small room at the angle of
the house, on the first story. It was very
scantily furnished: a spring mattress in an
iron frame, a child's bedstead, two trusses of
straw.</p>

<p>"Pierrot, your couch would be fit for a king."</p>

<p>We buried him in the straw with his clothes
on, and heaped clothes upon him. He was not
cold; he fell asleep.</p>

<p>But we lay, dying with cold, all three on the
narrow spring mattress, and the draught chilled
us to the bone. In vain we wrapped ourselves in
shawls and cloaks; we could get neither warmth
nor sleep. We had brought with us a candle, and
we let it burn, not without remorse, since we
expected many another night of the same kind.
A change of weather happened opportunely; the
wind suddenly rose and swept away the clouds;
we thought there would be a frost. A cold,
bleak wind was howling round the house; the
weathercocks creaked, the boards in the half-ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sheds cracked, and the 350 emigrants
shuddered with cold in the freezing rooms of the
farm and in the draughty barns. A mile and
a half away, at the sugar-mill, 360 others were
shivering in halls and cellars. In the guard-room
downstairs the soldiers gave a straw mattress to a
poor old man who had terrible pains in the back,
and who did not cease to wail the whole night
long. Upstairs, in the attic, there were forty
persons, among them fifteen children of charity.
There was no rest to their weeping, nor to the
patter of their feet. These small refugees, rather
than go down the steep, black steps into a colder,
blacker place, relieved themselves at the angles
of the beams, and we saw with horror a trickle
come from between the joists and run down our
walls. Twice heavy steps shook the lobby, the
door opened, a voice counted us: "One, two,
three, four...." The soldiers were going their
round. Half-frozen, we ventured downstairs
to go and warm ourselves in the kitchen. But
it was already crowded with about forty women
with their babies, either in front of the fire or
squeezed together on the benches. The air was
unbreathable, so we went back to our icy chamber.
Benumbed with cold, our limbs gathered up
together, our chins on our knees, our feet stuck
in our muffs, with a sore throat and a giddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
head we made up our minds to wait for the morning,
to take stock of our situation, and to find
out in what place fate and the Germans had
deposited us.</p>

<p>In the whole Thiérache, teeming with lovely
hamlets, I warrant that there is no other so
pretty as Jouville. It is perched half-way up
the hill on the high-road to Guise, and its houses,
first set in a straight row along the road, soon
take a short-cut, and then descend the vale,
where they meet with the purling Serre. They
dawdle there in small knots, and storm a second
hill, topped by a white steeple-crowned church.
This building is not in the least handsome, yet
it sowed dissension among the inhabitants.
Jouville-East-Hill laid claim to the pious edifice;
Jouville-West-Hill got it. Jouville-East-Hill
forthwith took to free-thinking, flung itself into
the socialist party, and swore it would never
cross the Serre to gratify the spiritual needs of
its souls. On the other hand, Jouville-West-Hill
took a most serious turn, swore only by
holy-water sprinklers and stoles, and sang nothing
but vespers and matins. Jouville, in ordinary
times, gives itself wholly up to cultivation of
apples, to cattle-breeding, and to wicker-weaving.
Each occupation adds a feature to the village. The
apple trees fill the well-kept orchards that hem it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
all around; those meadows that stretch afar off
feed the cows, and the willows, which will presently
be converted into baskets, form thick hedges
and make a draught-board pattern in the fields.
The village, indeed, is packed with osiers, cut,
tied in bundles, placed upright along the streets,
and watered by the brook. So they grow green,
and are covered with catkins, just like their
brothers that have not been cut. The houses
of Jouville are small, red and white, beneath
a slate hood; their windows laugh a roguish
laugh. On their roofs are fantastic weathercocks,
and in front of them small gardens, in
which box-trees flourish, cut into shapes. In
short, Jouville looks at once simple and smart,
modest and satisfied, and its mere aspect should
cheer up the way-worn wanderer. Though this
rustic Eden pleased us, we had no mind to take
up our abode in it. The day after our arrival,
we managed to ask an officer:</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What are we doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the departure has been postponed, the
organisers of the convoy are not in agreement."</p>

<p>"But how long are we going to stay here?"</p>

<p>"Not longer than a few days; you need not
be afraid."</p>

<p>Although we were forewarned, our simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
minds would not believe in duplicity. We were
reassured.... A few days would soon glide
by. When a soldier talked of a whole week, he
astonished us. The chief cook in the kitchen,
where he was superintending a swarm of busy
scullions, dared to murmur three weeks, and he
was hooted at by everybody. In the farm and
in the sugar-mill the emigrants settled themselves
as well as they could. A pitiful place, in which
straw was expected to do everything! The straw
served as seats and mattresses, it served as
blankets, it served as shutters and padding.
Nothing but straw to preserve oneself from
the cold. And the cold was terrible. I think
that we shall never suffer from anything as we
suffered from the cold in Jouville. It was the
icy chill of the seventh cycle of Hell, the chill
that pierces you to the very marrow of the bones;
it was the chill of death.... For a whole week
we tried vainly to warm ourselves. The weather
was clear; the wind blew with fury; the frozen
ground was as hard as stone; icicles were dangling
from the gutters; and the emigrants' teeth were
chattering. They bent their shoulders, thrust
their hands in their arm-pits, and wandered up
and down. Some had on only rough linen
clothes. From the yard they went up to the attic,
from the barns to the kitchen, in quest of a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
warmth, and they looked so cold that the mere
sight of them heightened your misery.</p>

<p>In the sugar-mill some people had the luck
to lodge in rooms that could be heated. But
what of those who dwelt in attics through which
the wind was blowing just as it did outside, or
in cellars where they sat in a perpetual draught?
The manifold misery we were the witnesses of
was beyond description. I remember a room
in the sugar-mill where about fifty emigrants had
been huddled together&mdash;men and women, old
people and children, in ill health or in good. It
was a long, icy-cold room, with a low ceiling,
feebly lighted by two deep windows in the shape
of loopholes. At the threshold the odour of
sick and dirty humanity suffocated you; the
children's squalling, the mothers' scolding, the
men's rough voices stunned you. In the dimly
lighted room you perceived a path opened through
the straw, spread out on both sides, on which you
saw creatures crouched or lying. You stumbled
on baskets, kitchen utensils, and bundles, had to
shun wet linen and children's clothes, which the
women had stretched out in the fallacious hope
of drying them. When your eyes got somewhat
used to the sober light of the place, you were
able to single out the sick or the old people lying
about the straw, the mothers suckling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
babies, the men leaning against the wall. You
saw their pale worn faces, their hands benumbed
with cold, their thin clothes. And if you stopped
to talk to them they told you many bitter,
heart-rending stories. In a corner a girl of
twenty was at the last gasp. She had but one
lung left, and spat blood, while small children
were playing about her. It was the hopeless
horror of a concentration camp. Yet the commandant
of the convoy, a lieutenant of the
reserve, a good man after all, and the father of a
family, did his best with the poor means at his
disposal. Once even we saw a tear roll down
his cheek at a distressing sight. The weather
being inclement, he gave orders to have the
greater part of the emigrants lodged in the
village. The sick first, then the women and the
children would be provided for. There was great
excitement. A choice was made, and after three
days and a good deal of writing, the farm and
the sugar-mill had but a hundred occupants
left, all huddled together in the few habitable
rooms. The rest encamped in empty houses,
slept on straw, a dozen in a room. At any rate
they were under cover, and could warm themselves
or accept the hospitality of the inhabitants
of the village. Such was our case. Charming
people gave us shelter, and placed two rooms at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
our disposal. We had beds. After we had
spent three nights on a spring mattress and
had shivered all the while, how pleasant it
was to go to bed! But our apartment was not
heated, had not been lived in for a long time,
was impregnated with damp, and, chilled as
we were, we recovered warmth only a few days
after.</p>

<p>The life of the camp was organised after the
military fashion. We were expected to obey
at a glance.</p>

<p>In the morning, as early as half-past seven,
the emigrants hastened to the sugar-mill or
the farm, where each was inscribed in the place
where he slept the night before. A grown-up
member of each family presented the cards
of those with him. In the two courtyards
the emigrants filed past from right to left, and
answered to their names mangled by the <i>Feldwebel</i>.
Then came the daily allowance of coffee. Armed
with saucepans, jugs, pots, and cups, women
and urchins went to the kitchen to have them
filled. They returned home, and at eleven o'clock,
with porringers, pails, and coppers, they made
again for the farm or the sugar-mill, to bring
them back full of soup. Towards evening they
wended their way a third time to fetch coffee
for their supper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>About twice a week we were told in the morning
that bread would be distributed at four o'clock.
It was another errand to run. Every one produced
his card, and received an allowance for
several days. If the <i>Feldwebel</i> announced: "In
the afternoon at three the emigrants will be
passed in review," the whole village was in a
flutter. It was no trifle to drag the old people
and the babies out from their heaps of straw,
to hold up the lame, to lead the blind, and to
persuade the idiots. The ragged army, every
day more beggarly, hobbled along to one of the
rallying points. In the evening about eight
o'clock the drum was beaten by way of curfew-bell.
Every one shut himself up and blew out
his candle, if he had one. Silence spread over
the village; the emigrants, laying aside their cares
for a while, fell asleep, and the night beneath its
veil hid unnumbered miseries.</p>

<p>We were forbidden to go out of the village,
and a pass was necessary if we would visit a farm
half a mile from the hamlet. We were real
captives, and no communication whatever was
allowed with the neighbourhood. What an organisation,
how many rules for such a short stay!
Some people will think ... a short stay! One
day followed another, and they were all alike,
and always saw us in Jouville. "Next week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the departure," the Germans said with unshaken
impudence. Hope put us to the torture. One
week followed another; we were still there.
For two months, eight long and tedious weeks,
we led this life of prisoners, thinking that the
next day would set us free. Every morning,
about eight, I left our lodging to answer to the
roll-call. I was generally behindhand, and
ran along the path that led to the farm every
day with a hope which sank and withered.
Shall we get news to-day? I hardly dared
believe it; yet, my feet being frozen, my face
cut by the wind, I made haste. In April the
weather grew no milder, but the approaching
spring was visible. A few flowers ventured to
show themselves along the hedges, and the birds
sang at the full pitch of their voices. Thus,
while I ran along, the blackbirds in rapturous joy
whistled each and all: "Fuit, fuit ... she had
faith in the Germans!"</p>

<p>The tomtit ruthlessly and unceasingly twittered:
"Sol, sol, mi ... sol, sol, mi ... you mustn't
trust any one ... sol, sol, mi ... and still
less the Germans ... sol, sol, mi...." And
the wind jeered at me from the naked branches,
and the bryony's small golden stars laughed in
my face, spreading its wreaths along the path.
I reached the farm, and the women gathered at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
once round me. If they caught sight of Geneviève
or Antoinette, it was the same thing: we were
taken by storm.</p>

<p>"Madam, madam, have you heard any news?
When are we going?"</p>

<p>"Alas! within four or five days the officer
said, but you know if he is to be believed."</p>

<p>A strain of protestations showered down:</p>

<p>"You will see, they will leave us here."</p>

<p>"Ah! we shall never go to free France!"</p>

<p>"They will take us to Germany. And we
can't go on living here! Our brats have no more
shoes; their clothes are in rags; it is no use to
darn them, they fall in pieces."</p>

<p>"But the worst is that we are hungry. We
could stand it, but our children, our little ones,
are hungry."</p>

<p>And it was only too true, we were hungry,
every one was hungry. What! Did the Germans
not feed us? Of course they did! And on
what! Twice a day each emigrant got a bowl
of coffee. A bowlful or a dishful as you liked,
this lukewarm beverage was not given out with
a niggard hand. Lukewarm it always was, and
thin too&mdash;stimulants ought not to be misused,&mdash;and
blackish with a smell of mud. It was without
sugar or milk, and there was no danger of feeling
heavy after you had swallowed it. If the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
fell a-weeping in the night, after having swallowed
one cup of this coffee for their dinner, their mothers
knew they were not going to have an attack of
indigestion. We got bread. It was real, authentic
German bread, kneaded and baked by Germans.
Coloured outside like gingerbread, it was turtledove
grey inside, and would have looked rather
tempting but for the unbaked or mouldy parts.
We supposed that rye-flour, pea-flour, and potato
fecula were largely used in the making of it.
Some pretended that they found sawdust in it too.
I could not affirm this. I was rather inclined
to think that chemicals had induced the heavy
dough to rise. When new, this somewhat sour-tasted
bread was nice enough, and we ate it
without distrust the first days we spent in Jouville,
as the bracing air gave us an appetite. Alas! it
soon caused us pains in the stomach, sickness, inflammation
of the bowels, in short put our digestive
organs out of order. The emigrants ate it all
the same; indeed they could not get enough of it.
The first three weeks the Germans made a show
of generosity: every person received a loaf
every third day. The weight of one loaf was
supposed to be three pounds, in reality it never
exceeded thirteen hundred grammes. But the
daily ration was sufficient, and nobody complained.
Unfortunately the allowance became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
more and more stingy; during the last month
every one received one pound every third or
even fourth day. One hundred and twenty-five
grammes&mdash;our daily pittance&mdash;do not represent
a large slice, and the people began to clamour
for food. We got soup. We were entitled to a
ladle of soup by way of lunch. Shall I describe
this mixture? Is it not already famous in both
continents? Do our prisoners not feast upon it
in Germany? It is a grey, thick substance
which curdles like flour paste, whose chief ingredient
is fecula. Each portion contained five
or six tiny bits of meat, coming undoubtedly from
over-fat animals, for we never saw a scrap of lean.
A few horse- or kidney-beans, a little rice or barley,
mixed with bits of straw, bits of wood, and other
scraps of vague origin. Antoinette had once a
real godsend. She discovered in her soup-plate
... she discovered ... how can I tell? Oh,
shade of Abbé Delille, inspire me to paraphrases!
She discovered one of those animalcules which
... plague take oratorical precautions! She
found a louse on a hair, the whole boiled. This
took away what was left of our strength, and we
swore we would rather waste away, and slowly
dry up, than eat such stew in the future.</p>

<p>"Look at this, madam, look at this hodgepodge,"
moaned the women. "At home we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
would not have given this rotten stuff to our pigs,
and now we must feed upon it, and give it to our
children."</p>

<p>M. Charvet, our host, cast a look of dismay
at our porringers.</p>

<p>"As to myself, I should die beside this, but I
would never taste it."</p>

<p>And yet the emigrants were obliged to eat it.
From the first days of our arrival we set our house
in order. Our bedrooms were at Mme. Charvet's,
but we spent the whole day long at the rural
constable's. The constable&mdash;a brave old man,
wounded in 1870&mdash;gave up his large kitchen to
us, and supplied us with wood at very little cost.
In a corner of the kitchen stood a large four-post
bed which received at night three of our protegées:
a lady eighty-five years old, and her two grand-daughters
aged seven and twelve years. Mme.
Noreau, Mimi, and Miquette were respectively
mother and daughters of a retired officer who
lives at Coucy. Of course the officer and his two
sons had not been allowed to go, and his wife
had refused to leave them. But they took the
chance of sending into France the grandmother
and the little girls, who had greatly suffered from
their life of privation. From the first evening,
the sight of these helpless figures upholding one
another had moved our pity. They gratefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
accepted our proffered friendship and assistance.
This is then the way we came to rule such a large
household at the old constable's. A good oven
served at once to heat the room and cook the food.
For excellent reasons our stew was of the simplest.
A few eggs, milk, sugar, and butter were to be
had in the village, but as we had absolutely no
other article of food&mdash;no meal whatever, no
vegetables, no meat,&mdash;we were hungry despite
custards and omelettes. I said we had tried to
swallow the soup. We gave it up on account of
the adventure afore mentioned after a fortnight
of earnest endeavours. So much the worse, we
said; we will live with empty stomachs. Many
others were in the same plight. We were privileged
beings, for only a few among the emigrants had
a little money, enough to get something besides
the usual fare supplied us by our jailers. I leave
you to imagine the appetite of those who were
reduced to bread, coffee, and soup in all. And
remember that among them there were two
hundred and eighty children under ten years
who were not merely starved, but half-naked as
well. The charity children were more miserable
than the others. In the bitter cold weather they
wound rags round their legs by way of stockings;
their shoes were shapeless things, held together
by string, their trousers were torn, their jackets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
had lost their sleeves, the girls' frocks were in
rags. Their distress melted the people of the
village to tears. Jouville has but four hundred
inhabitants, and if their religious and political
passions are lively, their hearts are none the less
warm.</p>

<p>Jouville-East-Hill and Jouville-West-Hill
showed themselves equally kind to the emigrants,
and not only kind, but forbearing, and the emigrants
needed forbearance. They were not the
<i>élite</i>, and they were guilty of many a misdeed.
M. Charvet well-nigh died of anger the day he
discovered that his beloved fish-pond had been
secretly rid of its finest inhabitants.</p>

<p>Another farmer was breathless with rage when
he saw the potatoes he had planted the day before
dug up in the morning.</p>

<p>Ah, you rascally emigrants! Of course some
people will feel deeply shocked at such behaviour,
and deem it a hanging matter&mdash;for instance,
well-fed people, secure from danger, who afar off
scowl at the Germans, the emigrants, and the
typhus-smitten people with the very same feelings.</p>

<p>But I who was once numbered with those
emigrants, who like them was a prey to hunger,
I could not find the smallest stone to throw at
them. And the inhabitants of Jouville, who
were the witnesses of our life, threw no stone either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
None of them caused our chains to be drawn
tighter by complaining to the Germans. For the
invaders of the north of France are very severe
to the people who transgress the eighth commandment ...
"Thou shalt not steal."</p>

<p>The Jouvillians did even better. From all
quarters they brought to us and to the school-mistress
of the village quantities of clothes fit
to wear, if not new, and these were distributed
among the raggedest refugees. We ourselves,
with two others, did our best to clothe the
orphan girls, and the poor things were extremely
proud of their new frocks made up of shreds
and patches. Some one gave them wooden shoes,
and the bruised little feet could patter down
the stony high-road without fear. The emigrants
soon looked upon us as their private property,
and thought us good for everything. An old
woman would come to us, for instance, with an
imperious air:</p>

<p>"I have been told that you are visitors of the
poor, and then ..." some request followed.</p>

<p>The unfortunate visitors of the poor would
sometimes have been glad to live on charity
themselves. Well, this reminds me that we did
once receive alms. We were following a path by
the river, bordered with pleasant houses. It was
a day of perquisitions, and the soldiers, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
turned everything upside down, had left the
quarter which we were traversing. A good old
woman was coming from the river-side with a
loaf in her hand, and the mere sight of the white,
light crumb made our mouths water. The woman
stopped, and said with a sidelong glance:</p>

<p>"You see, they don't want to know I have a
little flour left. I hid my loaf in the hole of a
willow tree."</p>

<p>She burst out laughing, and we chimed in.</p>

<p>I suppose she noticed our admiring gaze, for
she said all of a sudden:</p>

<p>"Would you like to have some?"</p>

<p>She tripped along quickly, and, with short steps,
went to her kitchen, came back with a knife, and
cut off two large slices, which she held out to
us. We seized the bread with an avidity hardly
tempered with shame, and stammered out joyful
thanks. This moved the compassion of the good
woman:</p>

<p>"Fancy, they are hungry! What a pity!
Such lovely girls!"</p>

<p>And so, jumping from one stone to another in
the muddy path down the river, we burst into
unrestrained laughter, and we devoured our
bread which was the real bread, the white bread
of France. We had, indeed, not a few windfalls.
M. Charvet more than once presented us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
one of those pretty round loaves, which he kneaded
and baked himself.</p>

<p>We also were hand in glove with a farmer,
who sometimes in secrecy let us have a few
potatoes or a pound or two of flour, and thus
gave us the means of adding something to our
meagre fare. A few treats of that kind helped
us to hold out! We looked like corpses, and we
were, one after another, the victims of strange
pains caused by the cold, the bread, and the continual
excitement.</p>

<p>Most of the emigrants were ill. Eight of them
died. We then had occasion to see and admire the
way in which the Germans organise the sanitary
service for the use of civilians. From the very
first day an empty house had been bedecked
with the title of hospital, and adorned with the
scutcheon of the Red Cross. A large room
directly opening into the street was chosen for
consultations; two smaller rooms containing
symmetrical heaps of straw served to receive the
patients. There was a permanent orderly in
the camp, and a doctor came daily from Marle.
Emigrants, choose what sickness you like! You
will be cared for!</p>

<p>And quickly influenza, diphtheria, bronchitis,
inflammation of the lungs burst upon the emigrants.
But we soon discovered that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
easy to be admitted to the sick ward. I had to
call four times on the officer before they vouchsafed
to take away an old couple who, despite
the Siberian cold, lived alone in a barn with big
holes in its roof. The poor woman coughed pitifully,
and her old companion could only bring her
lukewarm coffee and heap upon her mountains
of straw. She died two days after she had been
transferred to the hospital. An old woman died,
her body was carried away, and quickly another
old woman took her place on the very same couch
of straw. A dying woman, utterly unconscious,
was left a week unattended to.</p>

<p>"I assure you the corner she was in was a
very sink," said the man who took upon himself
to clean it when the corpse had been taken away.
"And my wife and children had to live in this
infected spot!"</p>

<p>Our medical attendant was a young coxcomb,
fair-haired, regular-featured, and harsh-looking.
A glass was fixed in his eye. About half-past
nine his carriage, drawn by a pretty horse, pulled
up; carelessly he threw the reins to his groom; he
alighted and penetrated his domain. His Lordship
sat down in an easy-chair, crossed his legs,
took a haughty survey of the patients who called
upon him, and spoke in a curt and supercilious
tone. He was soon held to be a villainous fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is as wicked as the devil," a woman said,
with a look of dismay.</p>

<p>A great many of them wanted their children
to be examined by the doctor.</p>

<p>"I would rather die on straw than go to him
for myself," a mother said ... "but, my poor
little girl!"</p>

<p>But what was worse, the Prussian doctor did
not care a fig for sick children! We had been
told that every baby was entitled to a litre of milk,
which one of the farmers of the village would
deliver to the mother on presentation of a note
of hand. But a child above two years was
allowed to drink milk only if the doctor deemed
it expedient for its health. A woman we knew
had a little girl not yet three. Six months
before the whole family had fled in a shower of
bullets and grape-shot, and for nearly a month
had lived in the depths of a dark stone quarry
with hardly anything to eat. Since then the
child had been as white as wax; she had no
strength at all, and she was always staring
straight before her as if she had beheld horrible
things.</p>

<p>As she was penniless, the woman was forced
to bring her child to this medicaster.</p>

<p>"Sir, you see my little girl ... I think milk
would do her good...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>He had but to write a note, and she would have
had it.</p>

<p>"Milk! I haven't any! I keep no cows in
my house!" and the doctor burst out laughing,
thinking himself very witty.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," the mother said with her teeth
ground, "when he stays at home there is a brute
beast in his house worse than a cow."</p>

<p>Another beggar woman had twins about two
years old. One of them ate soup and bread, and
throve like couch-grass. The other, who ever since
the family had left their native hamlet had fed
on indigestible things, and had nowhere to lay
her head, had grown pale and sickly. She had
ceased to run alone, took no food, and pined
away visibly. Her mother brought her to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"That child! What should I prescribe her?
She is ailing on account of her being French.
French children are all rickety and weakly. How
am I to help it? Lay the blame on your race."</p>

<p>Before leaving, the little doctor sometimes
gave a glance&mdash;a single one&mdash;at the rooms of
the hospital, then stepped into his carriage,
took up the reins, cracked his whip, and
as harsh-featured as ever put his horse to a
gallop.</p>

<p>However, some attention had to be paid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the sick. The orderly was there for that purpose.
He was a big stout man, whose eyes seemed
starting from their sockets. He did not like to
be called up in the afternoon&mdash;he took a nap&mdash;and
still less in the night. His remedies&mdash;the
same for every sickness&mdash;were most economical:
"Keep on low diet, apply cold compresses."
Yet he understood his business well enough.</p>

<p>Our hostess, Mme. Charvet, a wealthy landowner,
suddenly fell ill of a disquieting haemorrhage.
No doctor in the village, not even in the
neighbourhood. We ran in haste to fetch
"Goggle-eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, come!..."</p>

<p>"Goggle-eyes" lost no time in coming,
showed assiduous attention to the patient,
punctured her, and rode on a bicycle to Marle
in order to fetch medicines. A few days after,
a poor emigrant, mother of six small children,
was attacked by the same disease. He was sent
for in vain; and left her forty-eight hours without
help. It was indeed a miracle that she did not
depart this life.</p>

<p>This proves clearly that to the mind of a
German, even though he be a <i>Sozial-Democrat</i>,
the skin of a capitalist will ever be superior to
the skin of a starveling.</p>

<p>The physician was not our sole caller. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
few other ones came when the straw was still
clean, and when we received a pound of bread
a day. A stout commandant, and three days
after, a thin commandant came to visit the camp.
Both the stout and the thin looked extremely
well satisfied, and seemed to say:</p>

<p>"What splendid organisation! How perfectly
everything is getting on! Really, nobody
but Germans could settle things like that!"</p>

<p>The thin commandant was escorted by the
official interpreter of the camp. He never asked
a question of the people, for many reasons, the
principal being that he did know the language of
Voltaire. The very first day he had given a
sample of his talents by asking a youth:</p>

<p>"Hé ... vous ... combien hannées vous
havoir?"</p>

<p>And the boy, stretching his legs and hands,
stood there gazing, gaping at his interlocutor,
and his whole countenance answered:</p>

<p>"I don't understand German!"</p>

<p>Therefore mimicry and loud cries bore a great
part in the relations between soldiers and emigrants.</p>

<p>The stout commandant piqued himself on
French. In one of the rooms of the farm he
asked:</p>

<p>"You are comfortable here, aren't you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>And the women, pickled in respect, answered
all with one voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, yes!"</p>

<p>"You get good soup, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, yes!"</p>

<p>"You get a lot of bread, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, yes!"</p>

<p>"When you reach France you will tell the
French you have been leniently dealt with, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, yes!"</p>

<p>The stout commandant went away, proud of
himself and proud of being one of those Germans
who know how to organise camps for refugees.</p>

<p>"Rely on our saying how we have been dealt
with," bantered the old women, the moment the
officers' large backs were turned.</p>

<p>Another caller was a clergyman, who was quite
different from the others.</p>

<p>The Rev. Herr Freyer was about thirty-five,
he was tall, dark-haired, with malicious eyes and
a turned-up nose. I must say he did his best to
comply with our wishes and serve the cause of
the emigrants. From the very beginning he told
us that he was very fond of the French&mdash;yes,
but the Germans are all fond of the French&mdash;and
that his grandmother was of French descent.</p>

<p>"Why! then she had married a German?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, let us go on to something else.</p>

<p>This man was certainly the cleverest German
we had met, or rather the only clever one we ever
met. We were all the more amazed to notice
once more the abyss that separates the French
from the German mind. An utter incomprehension
of certain delicacies, a lack of sensitiveness,
is peculiar to them. If they had fallen from the
very moon, our ways of doing and thinking could
not be stranger to them.</p>

<p>And in discussion, they are unable to cast out
preconceived notions, which will ever get the
better of reasoning and observation.</p>

<p>Herr Freyer certainly wished to show us kindness,
and at every turn he told us things which
set our teeth on edge. Yet he wondered to see
us stand up for causes which he had looked upon
as lost since a long time.</p>

<p>"How I pity France," he used to tell us,
"poor degenerate France!"</p>

<p>And he looked quite scared when he saw our
anger, and heard our vehement protestations.
He was still convinced victory would be theirs.
On the other hand, he once declared to us:</p>

<p>"There is a blemish in the character of the
Germans ... they are kind-hearted to a fault.
The German nation is thoroughly kind-hearted."</p>

<p>Owing to the circumstances we dared not say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
all that we wanted to, and were content to hint
at Belgium....</p>

<p>"Oh, so many lies have been told! You
ought not to believe such slanderous accusations.
As to myself I know that what you are alluding to
is false; the Germans are too kind-hearted to
be guilty of the deeds they are charged with."</p>

<p>Such is our enemy's mode of reasoning. He
denies what they cannot excuse. It is very
easy.</p>

<p>"In Alsace-Lorraine we have been to blame
in every way," said the clergyman to us.</p>

<p>He is making confession, we thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have been too kind-hearted, over-indulgent
to the people. If we had had a firmer
hand, everything would have got on much better."</p>

<p>This blasphemer had some merit, let us not
be too hard on him.</p>

<p>Our leisure was propitious to gossip, and we
spent many an hour listening to those who had
seen the first tragical events of the invasion.
Their simple, unvarnished tales were like so
many nightmares. For instance, there were
bargemen of Braye whose boat had been split in
two by a cannon ball, and who had escaped death
only by swimming and clinging to floating planks.
There was the woman of Corbeny, driven by the
Prussians from a village near Soissons. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
several others she walked to Cerny at a stretch,
with the Germans ever at her heels. The unhappy
wretches had covered forty kilometres in
the midst of a battle, spent with weariness,
breathless, tumbling down, and trudging off
again. Three of them were killed on the way.
The woman who gave us an account of this
carried her baby, aged eighteen months, throughout
this wild race, and on the way the poor little
thing was wounded twice in her mother's arms.
Of Cerny were the poor creatures who were shut
up in a deep stone quarry, and stayed there with
scarcely any food for twenty-seven days. When
they were taken out and brought to Laon they
were pale, hollow-cheeked, and covered with
vermin; they could hardly walk by themselves,
and their eyes could not look upon the daylight.
"The people wept as they saw us go by," the
women said. During the first hours of their
sojourn in the stone quarry, there had been a
tragical incident. The fugitives were crouching
in the dark when an officer broke in, accompanied
with soldiers:</p>

<p>"Some of you," he said, "have harboured
Englishmen. We discovered an English officer
lying in such and such barn, in such a place. We
have set the building on fire."</p>

<p>"Ho," said a man, "my barn!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, it was yours! You knew an Englishman
was hidden in it? Come on."</p>

<p>The poor man vainly protested against the
accusation; he was taken away.</p>

<p>The following day he had not yet returned.
His wife was greatly disturbed, and despite the
danger made up her mind to go and try to see
him. She took some chocolate out of the slender
store of the refugees.</p>

<p>"They have thrown him into prison," she said,
"and I am sure they will starve him to death."</p>

<p>The woman went. The village was half in
ruins, and the ruins smoked. All was deserted.
She summoned up her courage, went straight to
her house, walked into the yard, and, close to the
dunghill, his face fallen in the filth, his hands
tied behind his back, saw the corpse of her
husband. He had been shot twice in the head,
and his side was pierced with a large wound.</p>

<p>The victim's brother and the niece from whom
we heard this story, were not allowed to attend
his burial.</p>

<p>From the same part were two ladies, a mother
and her daughter, with a new-born baby, who were
flung out of their house with only a dressing-gown
and slippers on, and driven on without stopping
at the bayonet's point, until they reached Laon,
half distracted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>To Cerny also belonged those seven men who
had been confined in the <i>mairie</i> of Chamouille,
and who saw an officer come up and yell in a
furious tone: "Your dirty French have discovered
our presence here. One of you must
have made signals. That's why we are getting
a shower of shrapnel." The civilians denied the
charge, and defended themselves. To no purpose.</p>

<p>"You shall spend the whole night in front of
the house, and if you get knocked on the head, it
will serve you right."</p>

<p>The men were drawn up in the street, and from
evening till morning stood there within reach of
their guards' revolvers. As if by miracle, the
cannonade ceased, and during the night not a
shot was fired upon the village. The next day
the prisoners were sent to Laon.</p>

<p>Less tragic but just as remarkable, was the
story of our companions Noreau, the grandmother,
so small, so weak, that we more than once thought
her death near at hand, and her darlings, with
their pale faces and their eyes encircled with black.
Major Noreau owned a large house in Coucy.
It pleased the invaders, in their omnipotence,
to take possession of eleven rooms, and to establish
their offices in them. The owners had but
the use of a single room, reserved for the sick
father. Mme. Noreau, her four children and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
mother-in-law, slept all the winter in a cold attic.
Some of them slept on straw, but the old grandmother
had, instead of a bed, ... a kneading-trough!</p>

<p>All the furniture had been carried away,
scattered about the village, or over the trenches.
To crown all, the family had suffered hunger
almost unceasingly. Coucy had been still less
favoured with provisions than Morny, and only
the farmers had managed to lay by some few
articles of food.</p>

<p>"One day," our old friend told us, "little
Mimi picked up from the dunghill a lump of
sugar an officer's servant had thrown to the dog.
She knew her mother had had no food the last
two days, and brought her this windfall."</p>

<p>The same little Mimi, after she had slept on
straw for months together, forgot, for want of
practice, her normal vocabulary, such words, for
instance, as sheet, and the first evening she
asked Antoinette, who had adopted her:</p>

<p>"What is the name of those things ... you
know what I mean ... those white things one
stretches upon the beds?..."</p>

<p>A great many emigrants were thrown out of
their villages in September, when the Germans
had been driven back. They had been pushed
forward like cattle, had been penned up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
citadel of Laon, and left there for weeks, for
months, sleeping on straw and starving. All
these unhappy wanderers were stranded at
Jouville. They had met again with their old
companion Hunger. They were persecuted by
the cold. Many lay groaning in the icy cellars of
the sugar-mill, or in the airy attics of the farm.</p>

<p>And then suddenly came the spring. It came
in one night. A light breath passed over the vale,
which was soon like a nosegay. The meadows
grew green, the hedges expanded their buds, the
trees put forth tender leaves, the groves were
embroidered with periwinkles. Beneath the
thorn bushes came up lords-and-ladies; violets
in tufts peeped out along the paths, and the
meadows were strewn with primroses. Six small
lambs in the keeping of a shepherd girl looked like
six white specks on the slope of the green hill.
The hedges were lively with songs and murmurs.
The spring wondered much that it did not see
the fresh idylls it was used to. Alas! Love had
fled; Venus alone, a lewd and venal Venus, saw
her altars besieged with a host of worshippers;
but pure chaste Love had no faithful followers
left.</p>

<p>Yet the spring bestowed with a full hand its
gaiety upon all Nature. I met once with five
small emigrants. The eldest was about eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
years old; their clothes were all in rags, their
feet walked naked on the stones. But they had
flowers in their arms, and their pale faces were
bright with the joy of the Spring. The joy of
the Spring! Could we feel glad at it? "The
month of May without France is no longer the
month of May." This corner of France was no
more France since we bore the yoke of strangers.
In vain we lay basking in the sun, with outstretched
arms. The sun could not, as once it
did, warm and burn us, as if to make us die a
voluptuous death. In vain did we listen to the
watchful nightingale, whose song overtopped the
noise of the water-gate. It expressed all the
ecstasy and passion of mankind; it could no
longer make us feel the sweetness of life. Our
hearts were benumbed with grief, and had no
taste for happiness.</p>

<p>Even the humblest of our companions, of our
neighbours, understood this contrast between the
sentiments of us all, and the joys which filled
Nature. And we heard poor women say in a
mournful tone:</p>

<p>"What misery! To think that we must live
with the Germans in such fine weather!"</p>

<p>We lived with the Germans. In their train
came all the ills&mdash;captivity, sickness, hunger.
We suffered hunger more than ever since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
ration of bread had been reduced almost to
nothing. The women made loud complaints, and
even talked of mutiny. The commandant of the
camp&mdash;it was no longer he of the first days&mdash;replied
to my complaints, lifting up his arms in
a gesture of impotency and indifference:</p>

<p>"They are hungry! How am I to help it?
I have nothing to give them. I had rather see
them eat! It wouldn't disturb me in the least!
Do you think I should care about it?"</p>

<p>A few women with their children and a cripple
ran away, thinking they might reach their village.
They were overtaken, some at five, others at ten
kilometres from Jouville, were thrown into
prisons without any further formality, and
sentenced to wait there for the departure in
which every one had ceased to believe. Two
girls did succeed in getting home, but were likewise
caught and brought back. These flights
rendered our supervision stricter than ever. We
had to answer to numberless roll-calls, and once,
when the <i>Feldwebel</i> was in a bad temper, he
called us all "a set of pigs!"</p>

<p>Our misery was alleviated at last, when the
American-Spanish Relief Commission began its
work. Jouville had already received some white
flour. The mayor of the village interposed to
obtain the same favour for the emigrants. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
succeeded, and the last week of their quarantine
the poor people got bread&mdash;white bread. The
first day we went to the baker we saw a stirring
sight. The children gazed in wonder at the
golden loaves; they squeezed, they smelt their
portion with joy, and without waiting broke off
pieces which they ate eagerly. I saw women
look at their share with staring eyes, and say
weeping:</p>

<p>"Bread, real bread!"</p>

<p>This happened the last week of our sojourn in
Jouville. Indeed the longed-for event was about
to take place. There were endless reviews and
verifications of names and civil conditions. The
men were examined, and re-examined by the
doctor, for all would not be allowed to leave. A
card with a number was delivered to every person,
and we were all ordered to meet in the yard of
the sugar-mill at eight o'clock in the morning on
Friday, the 14th of May. Different sentiments
prevailed. A few were overjoyed at the news;
others showed signs of despairing incredulity.</p>

<p>"God knows where they are going to take us
now! What will become of us? You will see
they will shut us up in Germany!"</p>

<p>But most of them suspended their judgment.
Not daring to hope, they anxiously waited upon
events. A still greater misfortune than we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
borne lay in store for us, Geneviève had caught
a severe cold about a month before, and the day
we heard delivery was near she was in bed,
shaking with fever. She spent a very bad night,
notwithstanding our care. In the morning I ran
for the German doctor&mdash;as there was no other&mdash;despite
the patient's protests.</p>

<p>"No, no, I will have no Germans about me.
Besides, there is nothing the matter that will
prevent me from going."</p>

<p>The fair-haired coxcomb gave a listless ear to
my words, looked at me between his eyelids, and
asked with his lips:</p>

<p>"Why did not this person come round for
medical advice?"</p>

<p>I replied that "this person" was in a high
fever, and could not get up. Fortunately another
doctor had come to help the former to examine
the people before they were allowed to depart.
He was a fat, red-faced, jovial fellow, who showed
great haste to oblige me, and repeated over and
over again as he accompanied me:</p>

<p>"Ah! le kerre! pien ture, pien ture!"</p>

<p>His diagnosis was alarming. A double congestion
of the lungs. He prescribed cold water
compresses.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and the departure...."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is quite out of the question! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
lady could not stand the journey. It is absolutely
impossible."</p>

<p>"Then ... we are not going either...."</p>

<p>"That is no business of mine."</p>

<p>And the doctor withdrew with a shrug of his
shoulders. Mad with despair we went to the
commandant of the camp, Antoinette and I.</p>

<p>"We cannot go. Our sister is ill; we cannot
forsake her."</p>

<p>"Why, you must go, you are not ill."</p>

<p>We did not know what saint to pray to; we
looked out for help. The mayor of Jouville
vainly went to the <i>Kommandantur</i> of Marle to
plead our cause:</p>

<p>"All emigrants in good health must go." Such
was the answer.</p>

<p>Geneviève tossed about her bed, and protested:</p>

<p>"I want to go; I will go. I will not run
aground, as we are reaching the port."</p>

<p>But the doctor, once more consulted, repeated
emphatically:</p>

<p>"Impossible, impossible."</p>

<p>"Then allow us to stay too."</p>

<p>"Impossible, impossible."</p>

<p>At length, towards evening&mdash;the whole camp
with the whole village sympathised with us&mdash;some
one told me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"An officer from Marle is at the Red Cross.
Go and try again."</p>

<p>We ran to see him. I well-nigh fell at his feet,
and besought him. He looked somewhat moved.</p>

<p>"Well, let me see what I can do. You are
sure the lady is unable to travel?" he asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Absolutely. She cannot be moved."</p>

<p>"I cannot be moved either," I cried. "Please
examine me. You will see there is something
the matter with my heart, and if I am driven to
go, it will be the death of me."</p>

<p>"Well," the officer said, "let us see."</p>

<p>His eyes gave consent. He turned to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"You might examine her, and see if the journey
would not endanger her life."</p>

<p>The doctor tossed his head, and smiled an
incredulous smile.</p>

<p>"Hum, hum, it can't be denied there is something
wrong with her heart," ... and, taking a
pen, he signed the slip which I so much desired.
What a relief! Geneviève would not be left,
seriously ill, among strangers.</p>

<p>"And I, what am I to do?" Antoinette
moaned.</p>

<p>"Ah! you must go."</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do. On the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
home I tried to encourage her, miserable as she
was at going away alone.</p>

<p>The next day I left Geneviève, burning with
fever, in Mme. Charvet's care, and went to see the
convoy start, heart-broken.</p>

<p>The sun lit up the scene; everybody was in a
flutter of excitement. Villagers had been requisitioned,
with carts and horses, to convey the
children, the infirm, and the luggage. The
crowd set out, under the conduct of the soldiers,
amid calls and shouts. Many emigrants were
crying:</p>

<p>"Where are we going to? Whither shall we
be taken?"</p>

<p>Several families were severed one from another,
for about fifteen men had been thought too strong
to leave the invaded territory. They might
turn soldiers, and fight against the Germans!</p>

<p>The charity children, delighted at the prospect,
flocked around me.</p>

<p>"You will come later on, won't you, madam?"</p>

<p>Old Mme. Noreau and her grand-daughters
faltered some words of sympathy, Antoinette
strove hard to restrain her tears, and Pierrot
dared not show his joy. I went with them as far
as the end of the village, where two gendarmes
were busy counting up the herd. I was not
allowed to go any farther, and I stood there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
gazing at the trampling crowd, and until I saw
them disappear at a winding of the road.</p>

<p>A halting-place had been arranged four miles
from thence, where a train was waiting to convey
the emigrants to Hirson. They spent the night
in the waiting-rooms, lying on the floor, sitting
on benches, all squeezed together with fluttering
hearts and anxious looks, disturbed by the
squalling of the children and the groans of the old
people. In the morning, the poor wretches were
carefully searched, and then crowded into the
train. Two days after they reached France.
With tears and cries of joy they greeted life, at
length recovered after so many trials.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>After eight months' hopeless waiting, after long
weeks spent in a flutter of expectation, we had
seen the gate of delivery closed upon us. The
others were gone; they were free; and Geneviève
and I alone still bore the yoke of invasion, which
no one loathed as much as we did. No one had
more eagerly wished for freedom, longed to return
home, and yearned to meet again those we loved,
and alone we stayed behind.</p>

<p>The poor girl thought that she would die of
despair rather than of illness, and while she
moistened her pillow with tears, I hid my sobs in
the attic.</p>

<p>Mme. Charvet took care of Geneviève, and did
her best to comfort us both. We did not follow
the prescriptions of the German doctor, and never
once applied cold compresses. A French matron's
experience is at times worth more than the learning
of a Teutonic physician. We applied mustard-poultices
and cupping-glasses; we gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
patient hot <i>tisanes</i> and syrups, which were all the
better because they were made in the village.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June, three weeks after the
convoy's departure, we arrived at Morny station,
in the care of a sergeant. My sister-in-law was
still a convalescent, and we trudged along to the
Bureau, where our guardian handed over his
prisoners. Thus we were restored to liberty;
we were no longer emigrants. And with beating
hearts we went back home.</p>

<p>On seeing us, my mother-in-law, Yvonne, and
Colette well-nigh turned into stone. They thought
we had been in Paris for two months at least.
We returned to our old habits; five women were
again under the same roof, five women in the
midst of invasion. One only had succeeded in
escaping.</p>

<p>No change for the better in the village. A
single detail amused us. The soldiers of the line
lived as before in a white house at the corner of
the street. For a long time, one of its stout
occupants, perched on a ladder, taking great
pains and putting out his tongue, had formulated
this wish in big black letters:</p>

<p>"God punish England!"</p>

<p>And now, on account of recent events, the
painter had added in a fit of rage:</p>

<p>"And the devil run away with Italy!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hussars of the farm were gone, Bouillot
at their head, and that day the village had
heaved a deep sigh. As a last theft, the Pandours
had carried away a cartful of furniture, in order
to make themselves comfortable in the trenches
which would shelter them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, two convoys were still
quartered within our gates, and troops of passage
were now and then billeted upon us. We gave
hospitality to a young lieutenant, who had succeeded
Bubenpech as commandant. He lodged
in the two rooms we had abandoned to the
Prussians with a heavy heart; he had requisitioned,
besides, "the small room" for his servant,
and the stable for his horse. Gracieuse and
Percinet, shut up in a corner of the coach-house,
would gladly have seen the Prussian mare dead,
which had usurped their domain. We, too, bore
a grudge against the fat Hans, who encumbered
our rooms with his person, his pipes, and his
clothes.</p>

<p>So, resigned to fate, we established ourselves
in the drawing-room, Geneviève and I. One of
the windows looks into the street, and when,
behind the lace of our curtains, we saw, hour after
hour, day after day, the same carts loaded with
straw, the same placid-looking Prussians,&mdash;they
are all alike,&mdash;the same stiff and sneering lieutenants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
we might have believed our stay in
Jouville had been but a dream. The invaders
seemed more "at home" than ever. The officers
enjoyed themselves according to rule. Of course
they had not waited for the spring to lead a
jolly life. As early as November 1914 they had
had drunken revelries. What merry evenings!
What dishes never tasted in Germany! What
floods of good wine! What erotic, patriotic, and
bacchic songs! "Let us drink and eat, for we
shall die to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"But no, we shall not die, we, who shout the
loudest, we are safe; we do not go to the front, we
stay behind, secure from danger. No other task
but to grind down, vex, and punish civilians!
Let us profit by the war. Joy's the word!
There was a festival yesterday at Laon; it will
be at Morny to-day; to-morrow it will be Coucy's
turn. Still more revels, still more junketings.
It is war, hurrah for the war!"</p>

<p>And all enjoyed themselves: those who cared
for nothing as well as those who cared first to save
their skin, sybarites as well as sentimentalists,
the pompous as well as the dissipated.</p>

<p>But this demands an explanation. We had
seen many officers of the reserve, the very men
whom the <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i> calls "the
flower of cultured German manhood"; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
we had discovered few varieties among them,
and all of them could be comprised in one
of the categories we had created for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Those who cared-for-nothing deserve careful
consideration. They partook of the qualities
common to their brothers-in-arms, which I will
extol farther on, but their pusillanimity or their
indifference belonged alone to them.</p>

<p>Such, for instance, was this lieutenant quartered
in Laon, who confided to every one willing to
listen to him:</p>

<p>"I don't care a fig for the fate of Germany!
If only the war would end soon, and I could get
on with my studies and make myself a good
position after.... I should be content."</p>

<p>Of the same kind was the young commandant
of the village, lamed by a fall from his horse.</p>

<p>"The war!" he said, "what do I care for
it? I am unfit for fighting, do you see. I shall
neither be killed nor mutilated, and it is all one
to me how long the war will last. I have comfortable
rooms, and get good dinners without
untying my purse-strings. I am well paid, and
able to save. When we are at peace again I
shall have a jaunt, and then go back to Germany.
Men will be rare, and I shall marry whom I
choose, the richest girl I can hear of, of course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
My future is assured, and so I am quite easy in
my mind."</p>

<p>We thought still more disgusting those who
first-cared-for-their-skin. We were pleased to
observe not a few cowards who strove with feet,
hand, and purse to avoid danger and keep behind
the line.</p>

<p>Love of life, self-esteem, a dislike for bloodshed,
and a natural dread of blows kept them
from the front. They thought but of one goal:
to cling at any price to safety.</p>

<p>I wrote "at any price" on purpose. Several
of them boasted they had paid for not being
sent to the front. Where, when, how, to whom,
I do not know. By what mysterious bribery,
by what surreptitious palm-greasing other people
will perhaps establish. The truth of such things
is not easy to ascertain. I can only state that
two officers and a sergeant, belonging to different
regiments, told those in whose houses they
lodged, one in Laon, the others in Morny and
Jouville, that they had paid from 4000 francs to
6000 francs to get leave to keep out of danger's
way. Thus they obtained a few months' respite,
after which they had to pay again or endanger
their lives.</p>

<p>When we were at Jouville, a stout sergeant,
nicknamed Tripe, well-nigh died of an apoplectic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
stroke on hearing he was ordered to go to the
front. "I have paid 4000 francs to be exempted
from fighting. I thought the war wouldn't last
so long! And now I have no money left!"
Mad with rage, he dashed his helmet right across
the room, and this martial attribute was picked
up with its point all awry. As to private soldiers
who told their hosts they had acted in the same
way, I will not even try to count them, they are
too many.</p>

<p>The other officers owned a certain number
of qualities in common. According to the individuals,
one of these characteristics eclipsed
the others, and the dominant feature helped us
to classify the fools.</p>

<p>Of the sentimentalists, Herr Mayor was the
best specimen. His eyes cast upon the blue
sky, he murmured his regrets in a voice broken
by tears: "His wife ... so many griefs ... and
so many dead ... how dreadful is war!
If only we could make a Holy Alliance of the
peoples!" I must say that Herr Mayor kept
his sensibility in his pocket, and took it out only
at dessert. In the discharge of his duties he
forgot this faculty completely.</p>

<p>The pompous officers were more entertaining.
Such was a certain cavalry officer who at the end
of September put up for a few days at M. Lonet's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
His name ended in "ski," he twirled his mustachio
after the Polish fashion, and drew himself up
most elegantly. Once upon a time he happened
to go through the drawing-room, where Geneviève
was talking with Mme. Lonet. The surprise
sent a thrill through him: "Why! two pretty
women! Quick! let us show off!"</p>

<p>And the braggart began to hold forth in praise
of Germany.</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>mesdames</i>, the emperor is extremely
satisfied with the march of our army. Our
gallant soldiers laugh at obstacles, and advance
as if by miracle."</p>

<p>This speech was made shortly after the battle
of the Marne. Unfortunately the hearers, as
well as the orator, were unacquainted with the
event, which, had they known of it, would have
given yet more meaning to the gentleman's
discourse.</p>

<p>The same <i>Rittmeister</i> could not refrain from
delivering high-sounding addresses to all whom
he met. In case of need he even fell back on the
man who split the wood or the maid of all work.
"Have you seen," he would say, "have you seen
our splendid Imperial Guard? Have you noticed
the gait of our soldiers? Do you know that no
troops in the world are to be compared with
them?" And for a revictualling cart that rattled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
by, for a soldier's shirt drying on a hedge, he would
pour forth his soul in dithyrambs on Germany's
greatness, invincibility, and might. You will
think, no doubt, that the first and foremost soldier
of the Prussian army, the supreme chief of our
enemy, would take his place, not without the
radiance of a star, among his <i>confrères</i> of pomposity.</p>

<p>Another pompous talker, a sub-lieutenant and
former law student, lodged in the spring of 1915
at Mme. Lantois'. He set up for a linguist, and
wanted us to believe he knew French better than
we. Once I brought him a demand-note to
sign. He carped at a word I used. I tried to
defend my prose, but he stopped me with a
motion of his hand:</p>

<p>"I know the word and how to use it."</p>

<p>I had nothing to do but hold my tongue, so
I did, like one thunderstruck. Unfortunately
the eloquent rascal took it into his head to turn
his stay in France to account. Are we to suppose
he thought he would thus acquire a few niceties
of speech of which he was ignorant? Nobody
knows. But he was often to be seen seated in
the big kitchen, devoutly listening to the conversation
of the workers, to the stories of the
old people of the farm, to whom Mme. Lantois
spoke sharply when they lingered too long. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
lieutenant knew how to listen, how to learn, how
to remember what he heard. For one day we
heard him say, thumping his fist on the table:</p>

<p>"Je savions ce que je disions!"</p>

<p>Among our guests were a great many sybarites.
Is Barbu's love of creature comforts still remembered?
And the many cushions necessary
to uphold his person? Can you imagine that
some of them, before choosing their room, felt
the elasticity of the mattresses, tried the softness
of the blankets, inspected the fineness of the
sheets? Are the nice afternoon-naps already
forgotten?</p>

<p>"We are at war! but that is no reason to give
up comfort. Let us have carpets and cushions,
wadding and down! We are sybarites!"</p>

<p>The category, to which we come now, the
brutes, is the most scandalously celebrated.
The present war has been its triumph. I must
say we never saw these gentlemen at their best,
such as they showed themselves in assaults, in
pillage, in massacre, in arson. We did see them
as brutes in their treatment of a peaceful, submissive,
terrified population,&mdash;brutes who thought
they had drawn in their claws. Bouillot, for
instance, was a beautiful specimen of the kind,
but we saw many another. For instance, there
was the hero, who had a small boy of Jouville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
bound fast to a post during an icy cold afternoon.
There was that other who knocked down the
shepherd-boy of Aulnois, and gave him a good
horse-whipping. The poor boy had gone beyond
the frontier of the commune with his cattle:</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" he said. "My master's
meadow is in Vivaise. I must feed my flock,
and at the office they won't give me a pass.
They say I don't want one to go those few
steps."</p>

<p>I should never finish telling the high deeds of
those scoundrels, and I have still to sing the
praises of the revellers. They were many in
number, and I think more dangerous than the
rest. They came to France, allured by the
depravity they attributed to us, and it was they
who brought to us their vices, particularly those
exclusive to their race, on which I had rather not
insist. No doubt they thought that they would
do a pious work in helping to pervert a country
which they hated. Be that as it may, they eagerly
exerted themselves to this end, and did their
best to transform the country behind the front
into a vast brothel. Of course such creatures
had not the least respect for the house which
sheltered them. An old lady in Morny was
deeply shocked at being forced to provide two
fast girls of Laon with lodging and board for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
some days, and many a country house, which
had never looked upon other than peaceful
scenes, was scared at revels, the noise of which
made the very window-panes tremble.</p>

<p>Bubenpech was a remarkably vicious specimen.
A bottle of champagne was never emptied in
the province without his presence. He was at
every feast, he took part in every rejoicing; he
rarely came home before two or three o'clock
in the morning. He had a pretty taste in wine
and nice dinners. Besides, he looked upon himself
as Don Juan, and expected every one to
yield to him. No thought hindered his caprices.
One day he asked a young girl publicly to come
and see him in his rooms. Another day we saw
him towards dusk kiss two loose girls in the
open street. To be at perfect liberty, he sent
to prison, under some pretence or another, a
man whose daughter he was paying court to.
He inscribed, among the women inspected by
the police, the name of a young girl who, though
not very respectable, had done no harm but
reject his advances. With real Gallic humour
our good villagers were careful to catalogue the
great deeds of our guests, chiefly when heroines
from the other side of the Rhine came upon the
scene.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, about ten o'clock, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
appeared at our house a little German nurse of
the Red Cross, dark-haired, smart, and&mdash;a fact
hardly to be believed&mdash;pretty; but the lady had
a peevish air&mdash;an air only.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Bubenpech?"</p>

<p>"Out."</p>

<p>With all possible speed the orderly went to
fetch the officer. Bubenpech came back as fast
as he could, shut himself up with the little dame,
and did not move until four o'clock in the afternoon,
forgetful of his lunch. And the orderly,
who timidly presented himself for duty, was
roughly sent away from the closed door.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mme. Valaine, shocked, "such
impudence! in my house!"</p>

<p>The neighbours made jokes and watched the
door. They even laid wagers: they will come
out; they won't. At last the couple came out,
and disappeared on foot towards Laon.</p>

<p>A moment after a murmur was heard:</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>To show his disregard of decency, Bubenpech
had thrown his window wide open before going
out. And now the whole village gathered about
our windows and jeered at the shameless disorder
of the room and bed.</p>

<p>So, while some officers clearly belonged to such
and such a category, they all possessed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
certain degree the qualities peculiar to the other
classes. But there were real mongrels among
them. For instance, you can imagine for yourself
a sentimental-fine-talker and a sybarite-who-cared-for-his-skin
or a brutish-reveller. And
there was a sameness in all, a family resemblance.
Prussian militarism, hypocrisy, and haughtiness
were smeared over them all like a thick coat of
paint. All showed an extreme satisfaction with
their own race and person. In short, you have
but to scratch the Prussian to find the barbarian.
Should an opportunity offer, or even no opportunity,
they can all be unreasonable, harsh,
unrelenting.</p>

<p>These gentlemen enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>In a physical sense, you can easily picture to
yourself those revellers. They were not handsome&mdash;at
least we never came across one we
thought handsome, in spite of our efforts to be
impartial. Save Bouillot, we never saw a very
tall one. They were either long and threadlike,
or short and fat. Those who thought they
had a look of Apollo you might reproach with
thick wrists and ankles, large hips, and heavy
feet. Most of them had shapely hands, and
very often well-kept nails. Their features were
unpleasing from being shockingly irregular or
freezingly regular; their hard eyes belied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
false kindness of their smile. At a distance,
their stiff and starched gait, their mechanical
movement; at close quarters, their voice, their
smell, their whole being made us bristle with
hostility. For a trifle we would have snarled at
them like a dog, and every day their presence lay
heavier on our hearts.</p>

<p>Their smell! Some people deny its reality.
Let them go to the North of France! When you
have lodged Prussian officers&mdash;very clean people,
no doubt&mdash;you may air the room eight days
running, and it will not lose the smell <i>sui generis</i>
which impregnates it, and every inhabitant of
the village, from the Mayor down to the smallest
child, would turn up his nose on entering the
room, and say:</p>

<p>"Faugh! it smells of Prussians here!"</p>

<p>Such as they were, the gentlemen amused
themselves. Some maintained even that they
made conquests. I am touching here on a very
delicate subject&mdash;the relations between the invaders
and the women of the invaded countries.
There has been much talk of rape. Compared
with the crimes committed in Belgium and in
Lorraine, the misdeeds we shall mention are but
little things. To be sure, there were rapes, but,
thanks be to God, they were few, and they took
place at the beginning of the invasion, chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
after the Germans' retreat on the Marne. In
Jouville I heard many a sad story. There was
the story of a young woman of Chevregny who
went mad after her misfortune, and of several
old women too. For, hardly credible as it seems,
old women often fell victims to acts of violence,
because they lacked agility to run away. At
Braye, several soldiers fell upon a woman of eighty,
knocked her down, and beat her most unmercifully.
At Chamouille, in October 1914, a few
women were living in a cellar, frightened to
death. "One evening," one of them told me,
"we heard a loud cry; there was a falling of
stones, and a young woman tumbled down into
the cellar through a shell-hole. Thus she escaped
from her pursuers, but her companion, an old
woman of sixty-eight, fell defenceless into the
hands of the filthy fellows."</p>

<p>Ah, we had many proofs of the respect the
Germans have for old age!</p>

<p>A woman of Cerny, eighty-seven years old,
small and white-haired, with red eyes and a
shaking head, told us how she had left her lodging.
"I had a small bundle of clothes ready lying on
the table. But the soldiers did not allow me to
go in and take it; they beat me. As I didn't
go&mdash;I had money, too, in my bundle&mdash;they forced
me to go; they all flocked around me, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
twelve, and ... how am I to say it?..."
In short, the twelve rascals had driven the poor
old woman out of her house by directing towards
her that which a famous statue innocently eternises
in Brussels. Stripped of her spare clothes and
money, filthy, disgusted at what she had seen,
the unhappy woman had to go to a neighbour
to beg for a bodice and a petticoat, that she
might cast away her soiled clothes.</p>

<p>When the Germans settled themselves upon us,
these feats of the satyr were no longer common.
Here and there evil deeds were still spoken of,
and a doctor of the neighbourhood told us in the
spring of 1915 that nearly every week there was
an act of violence. I must confess that many a
woman was the victim of her own imprudence.
When you have lived all your life in a quiet
village, among kind people, you have some
difficulty in believing that you must be on your
guard for months together, that you are for ever
surrounded with brutes. So more than one
villager had reason to regret having gone alone
to the forest, or having persisted in living in a
lonely house.</p>

<p>But the systematic brutalities, the collective
assaults, which marked the beginning, were no
longer known. The method had changed. There
were acts of violence which were no less terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
for being moral. In many a village whose inhabitants
suffered hunger, the children were
provided with bread and soup. Yes, but this
privilege was reserved for the children whose
mothers showed themselves complaisant towards
the soldiers. And these women accepted dishonour,
because they could not bear to see their
little ones pine away and die, while others could
not withstand the troubles and vexations that
lay in store for good women.</p>

<p>A cry of reprobation and horror arose when
we heard that the conduct of all women was not
blameless. In the first place there were the
women of the lowest class. Even Boule de suif
herself would have been tamed after daily relations
with the German soldiers. Of course a few black
sheep are a disgrace to the flock, and I can fancy
women-haters shrugging their shoulders in scorn
when they hear of this.</p>

<p>Gently, sir&mdash;a truce to jeering. More than
one person wearing a beard gave abundant proof
of an equal complaisance. Alas, traitors were
to be found among us. For instance, there were
those who welcomed the Germans with a smile,
and revealed to them the resources of the place.
There were those, the foulest of all, who denounced
French soldiers hidden in the woods or those who
fed the fugitives. There were those who, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
little money or food, pointed out the hiding-places
of his neighbours, and thus surrendered to the
enemy wine, grain, potatoes, even money and
jewels. But I am pleased to say that such
despicable wretches were rare, and on the whole
the population was proud and dignified, and
opposed to the invaders' dishonesty a solid
brotherhood, which no troubles, no persecutions
could lessen or fatigue. And yet we led a
grievous life; the Germans seemed to aim at
making it as hard as possible, while theirs was as
merry as can be.</p>

<p>The winter had been painful, but the summer
was still more so. We had less liberty and less
food. We were allowed to leave the place we
lived in but three times a week, and on stated
days. Besides, we had to ask for a pass two days
beforehand, and pay seventy-five centimes for it
when it was granted, which was not always the
case. It was almost impossible to go to the
country from Laon, and for weeks together nobody
was allowed to leave the town. One day passports
had been freely given to the people, tradesmen
mostly who went to Marle to buy raw sugar&mdash;a
yellowish sticky substance with a taste of glue&mdash;and
a little butter, precious goods that were still
to be found there in small quantities. They all
came back furious. At different points of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
road, level-crossings, outskirts of villages, they
had all been arrested.</p>

<p>Men and women had been then entirely stripped
of their garments, and searched according to rule.
Nurses of the Red Cross and soldiers showed
equal zeal in the task, which had a practical object&mdash;the
gathering of all gold and even silver coins
of five francs which pockets and purses might
contain. The sum seized, it must be said, was
replaced by notes of the Reichsbank.</p>

<p>The victims thought the joke a very bad one,
and I am sure Thomas of Marle's bones must have
turned in his grave. To think that on this
nobleman's own territory soldiers arrested and
robbed the passers-by, and he not there to help!
And, what is worse, the aggressors were German
troopers, and the victims good and loyal French
citizens! What does your shade regret, O
famous plunderer? To be unable to fight for
your countrymen, or to have no share in the
robbery?</p>

<p>I need not say that after that no gold pieces
ever ventured out on the roads.</p>

<p>A pass also was necessary to go out into the
country, and you were expected to have an
identity card in your pocket if you but stood on
your threshold. All papers had to be renewed
every fortnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fancy," an aged woman said to us, "that I
have to pay twenty marks because I forgot my
antiquity card!"</p>

<p>One Saturday, a farmer's wife, perched on a
ladder out of doors, was eagerly polishing the
glass of a bull's-eye window.</p>

<p>Two gendarmes on horseback passed by and
gave heed to this commendable zeal:</p>

<p>"Matam! ... carte...."</p>

<p>"Hem, hem! Ah, yes, my identity card; wait
a minute, it is lying on the table...."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! no, not enter ... no card ...
fine...."</p>

<p>So she had to pay the fine.</p>

<p>One of our neighbours was taking his cows out
of the stable. Suddenly one of them seemed to
smell some enlivening odour&mdash;was it that of
powder?&mdash;she bent a frolicsome head on one side,
lifted up her sprightly nostrils, raised a swaggering
tail, and, as fast as she could tear, went full gallop
towards the meadows, the brooklet, the rosy
horizon where the setting sun pleased her. The
owner took to his heels in his turn, and fled after
the giddy-pated creature. The better to run, he
tore off his jacket, and succeeded in getting
hold of the tether. Then he stopped panting,
all in a sweat, and rapped out a tremendous
oath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>As if by miracle, a gendarme happened to
stand there, his note-book in hand.</p>

<p>"Card, card...."</p>

<p>"Ah! oh, it is in my jacket pocket...."</p>

<p>The jacket was smiling in the distance, a small
spot lying on the green.</p>

<p>"Ach!" the Prussian said with a sneer,
"not fetch: fine."</p>

<p>Cost fifty francs.</p>

<p>Rascally cow!</p>

<p>I treat the matter as a joke. Sometimes we
did joke. We could not have our minds always
on the stretch. We already were half-crazy, and
we should have gone quite mad if we had not
occasionally laughed. We often laughed, with
rage, with an empty stomach, with our brain
confused after a troubled night. Our race needs
to laugh in the midst of tears, and tears are shed
in secret, whereas laughter bursts forth in public.</p>

<p>When the Germans laugh, it is always a peal.
As to tears, they trickle down their cheeks for a
trifle; they bathe in them, they pour them forth
everywhere. I had always looked upon this
lachrymal faculty so often spoken of as a legend,
but we have come to the conclusion that there is
nothing more real.</p>

<p>An untoward event, a deception, bad news, or
simply home-sickness and melancholy&mdash;anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
is an excuse for tears. Here is a famous example.
Those who have visited the battlefields of Mars-la-Tour
and Gravelotte have seen the famous
monument&mdash;a granite armchair in the midst of
a lawn, surrounded with a balustrade. This noble
simplicity should speak to the soul of itself. Yet
an inscription explains:</p>

<p>"During the battle of Mars-la-Tour, the
Emperor Wilhelm the First sat here and wept."</p>

<p>Of course he thought the game was lost. But
if his descendants are faithful to tradition, where
will they get the torrents of tears they will have
to shed within a short time!</p>

<p>However, we are not always crying. We even
tried to enjoy the summer, to make up for the
sad spring we had spent. As we had to plead a
practical object to obtain leave to take walks out
of the village, we begged to be allowed "to go
and fetch wood."</p>

<p>And, lying on the grass in the open country,
we tried to forget the war for a few moments,
Geneviève and I, lost in the surrounding calm and
beauty; but distant rumours soon belied our short-lived
illusions, and dispelled the poor creations of
the fancy.</p>

<p>No, it was not peace. Our stomachs, always
clamouring for food, never failed to tell us so.
During the month of June we hardly ate anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
except asparagus and cherries. These things are
not highly nutritious. No potatoes, a slice of
horrid, sticky, sour German bread. Then came
carrots, green peas, and artichokes, and we no
longer starved; and when in the second fortnight
of August there arrived the food sent by the
Spanish-American Board of Relief, we thought
we had been transported to a Land of Cockayne.
Twenty grammes of bacon daily, a dish of rice on
Sunday, a dish of beans on Thursday, eatable
bread; what would you ask more? No matter.
I wonder, when we are once out of this vale of
hunger, how long it will be before we recover our
former health.</p>

<p>During the month of July we spent the hot
hours of the day out of doors stretched on the
grass. Being near a field of corn, we put out a
timid hand and from time to time broke off ripe
ears; we rubbed them between our fingers, and
their plump grains, stripped of the husks, seemed
to us delicious food. It was strictly forbidden to
pluck corn, "however small the quantity might
be." "Our leather bags may be searched," we
thought, "but they cannot make a post-mortem
examination of us to make sure of a possible
theft." For there is no doubt that we were
committing highway robbery to the prejudice of
the Germans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had yawned the whole long day
away, in wearisomeness and hunger, we might
have hoped to slumber at night, for sleep is as
good as a dinner.</p>

<p>Alas! remember the Germans' revels! These
gentry were no longer allowed to find their
amusement out of the village in which they were
quartered. Every night the officers of Morny will
disport themselves in Morny!</p>

<p>Yes, indeed! They spent their evenings in
a house which they had transformed into a casino,
amid laughter and songs. Only the immediate
neighbours were kept awake. But about twelve
or one o'clock we never failed to start up in our
beds, as the songs and cries came nearer.</p>

<p>"Here are the brutes going home. What
whim will they take into their heads to-night?"</p>

<p>We heard them approach to the strains of
accordeons and mouth-organs. From upstairs
we saw them dressed up like women, with plumed
hats on, stopping at every door, trying, it would
seem, who could bawl the loudest. Or they
tricked themselves out as house-painters, carried
buckets and brooms and set high ladders against
the walls, and climbed up as if to storm the house.
Another time they would pretend to be strolling
musicians, and, armed with saucepans and
cauldrons, would give a mock serenade that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
have put the dead to flight. Or, what was far
worse, the noise of their steps would be scarcely
audible; they would talk in whispers and stifle
their laughter.</p>

<p>And, lying in the dark, we said to ourselves,
still half asleep:</p>

<p>"They seem quiet to-night; perhaps we shall
be able to go to sleep again."</p>

<p>But all of a sudden: bing, bang, formidable
blows with revolvers shook the wooden shutters,
and resounded in the room like peals of thunder.
The unexpected noise startled us out of our torpor,
and we could hardly recover our breath.</p>

<p>The next day, Mme. Lantois, half-sour, half-sweet,
asked her lieutenant:</p>

<p>"Well, you had some fun last night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! We knocked hard at the windows
of all houses where there are young girls."</p>

<p>Maybe the officer read disapproval in the
features of his interlocutor, for he went on:</p>

<p>"We are merry.... You may be sure that
the French officers amuse themselves in the same
way...."</p>

<p>In the same way? Oh no, Mr. ex-law
student of Heidelberg!</p>

<p>One evening, an officer whose rooms were not
far from our house refused to take part in a
drunken orgy. He was tired; he had a headache;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
in short, he preferred to go to bed. There were
guests in Morny, and before they left to drive home,
the whole band made an irruption into the
refractory officer's room, tore him from his bed,
and, with shouts of laughter, hoisted him into the
visitors' carriage and ordered the coachman to
drive on.</p>

<p>At the end of the village our man was stripped
of his night-shirt, deposited on the road, and his
comrades went away at full speed. As naked
as when he was born, he had to walk along the
high street to get back to his quarters.</p>

<p>The commandant of the village, to whom we
gave hospitality, did not care to put a stop to
these extravagances. Being but twenty-five, he
had little authority over his comrades, and besides,
from time to time he liked an orgy himself. He
was famous for his worship of Bacchus. He
was as long as a day without bread; he had a
small boy's head, adorned with large outstretched
ears at the top of it. The women of the village,
at the sight of his slender calves, had surnamed
him "Jackdaw's Leg." More stupid than bad,
he felt frightfully dull at Morny, and talked with
raptures of his stay in Belgium. "What a good
time I had of it!" he used to say. "I was drunk
from morning till night!" That he might not
get quite out of practice, Jackdaw's Leg tippled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as often as he could, and many a night his unsteady
legs were at much pains to convey him home
without accident. We knew him by his uncertain
gait; and when drunk he never failed to prevent
us from sleeping the livelong night. He sought
laboriously for the dancing keyhole. Then he
banged-to the door. At length he succeeded in
getting to his room, and his door was hardly shut,
when the result of his excess burst forth noisily
and&mdash;sinister detail&mdash;we perceived a characteristic
clash of washhand-basin and slop-pail. Then
desperate hiccups, groanings, and sighs were
audible, and the whole house resounded with his
laborious efforts.</p>

<p>Upstairs we heard Colette, furious and disgusted,
rail against the tipsy fellow:</p>

<p>"You dirty, loathsome brute ... pig...."</p>

<p>Then nothing was heard but snores. The
officer had certainly flung himself upon his bed
with his boots on.</p>

<p>And the following morning plump Hans, his
servant, was to be seen all a-flutter running to
and fro with water, pails, and floor-cloths. Sometimes
the painful scene took place in the street;
the disreputable traces of it were still to be seen
on wall and pathway the next morning, and the
lieutenant made for his rooms with deep sighs.
Yet he was able to walk by himself to our house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
What could we say of that captain who, in
Jouville, used to be wheeled home in a barrow by
his servants?</p>

<p>At that time an adventure happened by night
which I cannot recall without an inward thrill of
fear. It was already late in the evening, and we
were shut up in our room, Geneviève and I.
Our windows were open, and the strong wooden
shutters were carefully closed. We had been
talking for some time, lying in the dark, and were
about to fall asleep, when we heard a carriage
rattle by and then stop at the farther end of the
house. It was about half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"Kolb, Kolb," cried a loud voice.</p>

<p>Such was the official name of Jackdaw's Leg.
A silence followed, then the owner of the voice
seemed to grow impatient.</p>

<p>"Kolb ... Kolb ... Kolb...."</p>

<p>No answer came. The uproarious fellow
bellowed:</p>

<p>"Kolb ... Kôôôôlb...."</p>

<p>I bounced out of bed, still drowsy.</p>

<p>"This man will wake up the whole street," I
murmured. "I believe we had better answer."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Kolb is at the casino," I cried
from behind the shutter.</p>

<p>"What?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>I thought my interlocutor fifteen yards from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
thence, in front of the gate. My hand leaning
against the fastening unconsciously turned it;
all of a sudden it was wrenched from my grasp
and the shutters flew wide open. As quick as
lightning I shut the window, stuck to the wall,
and slipped behind the piano. Geneviève had
started to her feet and stretched herself at full
length along the bed. We saw the man produce
an electric lamp from his pocket, and, with his
nose flattened against the window-pane, try to
catch a glimpse of the inside of the room. The
curtains prevented him from seeing clearly anything,
but we got a full view of his person.</p>

<p>He was a captain, colossus-like, thick-featured,
and red-bearded; he had a helmet and a grey
coat on. He sat on the window-sill, and muttered
in a clammy, drunken voice:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, open the
window.... I want to wish you a good morning ...
shake hands with me.... Mademoiselle,
open the window."</p>

<p>We held our breaths, we dared not stir a
finger.</p>

<p>Then the officer got up, stepped backwards,
took a survey of the house, and made for the
next window. He shook the shutters, which did
not give way, and went to try the others. How
eagerly we wished the orderly had shut up everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
at his master's! The first window held out,
the second too, but the fastening of the third one
yielded, and we heard the man jump into the
room. As if he knew the ins and outs, he swiftly
crossed both rooms and the passage, and stopped
at our door.</p>

<p>"Open...."</p>

<p>He gave a knock ... then made an endeavour
to open the door.</p>

<p>We were struck with dismay.</p>

<p>With a shove of his shoulders he might have
forced the lock. With naked feet and nothing
but a nightgown on, how should we have been
able to stand up against this booted, armed giant
if he had broken in? Noiselessly Geneviève
sprang towards me. I softly opened the window
overlooking the garden, and we jumped out, careless
of the pebbles that bruised our feet, ran along
the house with all possible speed, and stopped at
my mother-in-law's window.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, open the window."</p>

<p>Our voices were low, but so anxious that the
shutters immediately flew open. We climbed in
like cats and hastily closed the window. With
strained ears we listened to the intruder's goings
and comings, but he soon jumped out of the
window, and after renewed calling and knocking
we heard his carriage roll away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>We prudently waited some time before venturing
out, then we poked our noses into the passage,
and, making sure the enemy had really withdrawn,
we took once more possession of our own room.
But, alas, our emotion had destroyed all chance
of sleep.</p>

<p>Day after day, night after night, alarm upon
alarm, the summer glided by. Then came the
harvest-time. The farmers were much agitated,
for the Germans had declared that they would
gather in the harvest.</p>

<p>They did so.</p>

<p>Ah, the birds will long remember the summer
of 1915!</p>

<p>The harvest lasted three months, and all that
time the grain strewed the ground. Every overripe
sheaf lost in transport half its wealth.</p>

<p>"They are but lazy-bones, the whole pack
of them," M. Lantois muttered between his
teeth. "When we gather in the harvest, we get
up at three o'clock and work till eight or nine,
and we hurry over our meals. But those fellows!
they get up at six, leave off work from eleven to
one, and have done with it at five!"</p>

<p>If the soldiers did not tire themselves out, the
civilians they employed showed no eager haste
to do things properly.</p>

<p>The peasants were full of indignation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"If those idiots had allowed us to gather in the
harvest on the condition that we gave them half
or even a third of it, they would have had more
corn than they have now, and we should have
been provided for the whole year!"</p>

<p>However, the Prussians at last understood
that more speed was necessary. And since all
the able-bodied men were requisitioned, it was the
turn of the women. The rural constable announced
one evening that women who would
work in the fields would receive two francs a day.
This aroused a great deal of wonder. In the
times we lived in two francs were looked upon as a
large sum, and many women hired themselves
out willingly. A week after, there was a sudden
fall in the tariff. The women heard they would
be paid only fourpence a day, and the female
workers dwindled to zero. The soldiers, in a
rage, tried to enlist the women in their very
houses. But they did not succeed. One had a
bad headache, another was in bed, a third was
nursing her baby, a fourth was sitting up by her
sick mother, and so on.</p>

<p>This state of things did not last long. The
military authorities issued an order, which enjoined
all women from sixteen to fifty to be on the
<i>place</i> of the village at such an hour, to be enrolled
as day-labourers. Mothers of young children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
alone were exempt. We looked at one another
in bewilderment. Why, then, we had to go
too! But if we can wield the pen and the needle,
and on occasion the broom, we are not trained to
handle the sickle, the spade, and the rake.
Besides Geneviève was hardly recovered. Colette
is as slender as a reed, and if Yvonne and I
are far from being viragoes in times of peace,
we were still weaker after a year of privation and
trouble.</p>

<p>"The little of health and life we have left
would be lost in the fields," said Yvonne.</p>

<p>"I won't risk it," said Geneviève. "I had
rather go to prison. Let them take me to
Chalandry!"</p>

<p>It was at Chalandry that the Germans had
installed a prison for women.</p>

<p>Jackdaw's Leg good-humouredly reassured us
in his most Teutonic accents:</p>

<p>"The measures in hand concern but the
peasants," he said.</p>

<p>It is worth while remarking that the officers
did their best to be on tolerable terms with their
hosts, and when the inhabitants were ill-treated,
the head of the house was sure to be away.</p>

<p>Now, Jackdaw's Leg had been feeling very
poorly for some weeks. Was it due to home-sickness
and to a longing for sauerkraut and sausages?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Or might it not rather come from too many merry
parties? In short, the commandant seemed to
languish, and ten times a day lay down on his
couch. As he had two bedrooms at his disposal,
he slept in one bed by night, and&mdash;for variety's
sake&mdash;in the other by day, unmindful of the fact
that he thus requisitioned two pairs of sheets a
week, that soap was scarcely to be had, and that
the poor washerwoman had to whiten the linen
with wood ashes. Jackdaw's Leg, being ill, got
a month's leave of absence, and disappeared in the
background. His place was filled up by the
young linguist who had put up at Mme. Lantois'.</p>

<p>He would gladly have seen us dead.</p>

<p>Calling on his brother-in-arms, lingering
without a motive, or for a wrong motive, in our
garden, in our lobby or on our threshold, peeping
through the keyholes&mdash;we once detected him in
this occupation&mdash;he had discovered that our souls
were not unworthy of associating with his, mad
for music and philology, enamoured of art and
culture. Notwithstanding that we had the reputation
of hating the Germans, this nice Prussian,
who produced in tippling-houses a list of at least
one thousand and three names&mdash;the list of his
conquests in France&mdash;this nice Prussian then
gave us to understand that he would condescend
to enter into relations with us, relations based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
on philosophy, science, and literature. Why not
on politics?</p>

<p>We responded in such a manner to his advances
as to convince even a Prussian. And
since then the fellow had borne us a dangerous
grudge.</p>

<p>Two days after the departure of Jackdaw's
Leg we heard a beat of the rural constable's drum ...
women from sixteen to fifty ... one o'clock ...
market-place.... We hardly listened to it.
It was no concern of ours. But at one o'clock
Mme. Lantois ran up breathless: "Do you
know that the lieutenant just said that <i>everybody</i>
must go to the market-place? He even told us
that if you didn't go, he would send four soldiers
to fetch you, and take you off to Chalandry."</p>

<p>Consternation! Alarm! It was twelve o'clock
according to German time. Without waiting for
luncheon we ran out in all directions to look for
substitutes. At one we arrived on the <i>place</i>,
attended by four old women, still hale and hearty,
and well pleased to fill our places, for of course to
the scanty pay of the Germans we had agreed to
add the usual price of a day's work. The sight
of the place suggested a picture of the slave-market.
Women, wearing light blouses and
coarse linen aprons, had gathered on both sides.
To shield themselves from the glare of the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the most of them wore a handkerchief tied under
the chin; a few of them laughing, tossed their
sunburnt hair, and many with weary faces leant
against the tools they had brought. There were
gloomy-eyed women, who up to that time had
never done any work but housekeeping; there
were young girls, carefully looked after by
their mothers, who did not know what to do
with themselves; there were sedate, stern-looking
workers, and at last the usual set of
soldiers' wenches, laughing at and making fun
of the others, noisier than the rest of the company,
and thinking that they might do what
they liked.</p>

<p>Under the shade of the plane-trees was seated
Jacob&mdash;such was the Christian name of the
lieutenant, and no one gave him another&mdash;busy
calling the names over. Ours was among the
last; we answered without wincing, and then
presented our substitutes. Thus did we baffle
the trick which Jacob wanted to play us.</p>

<p>This enforced service brought about many
troubles between the invaders and the inhabitants,
so the Germans had prudently turned the sugar-mill
of Aulnois into a prison for male culprits,
and converted a house at Chalandry into a jail
for women. And if you showed the least disposition
to disobedience, you were immediately taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
into custody. Did you call a private soldier such
names as he had deserved a hundred times? To
prison with you. Had you kept back any goods
from the perquisitioners? To prison with you.
Were you unwilling to comply with the requisitioners'
orders? To prison with you. Were
you penniless when liable to a fine? To prison
with you, to prison, to prison!</p>

<p>Half a dozen men from Morny were for ever
ruralising at Aulnois. Of course it is no disgrace
to be put into prison by the Germans, but
it is a well-known fact that the diet of the Prussian
jails is anything but engaging.</p>

<p>A girl of sixteen coming back one evening from
the fields threw her pickaxe on her threshold,
and cried out in tears:</p>

<p>"I won't work any longer for those barbarians!"</p>

<p>An indiscreet ear overheard the sentence,
which was repeated in high quarters.</p>

<p>Now, the word "barbarians" is to a German
like a red rag to a bull.</p>

<p>So, two days afterwards, the family of the
imprudent little person were awakened out of
their sleep at four o'clock in the morning. A
sergeant and four men came to fetch the guilty
girl and take her to Chalandry. Half an hour was
granted her to get ready. Mad with despair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
shaken with sobs herself, she left her parents sunk
in desolation and in tears. They even did not
know how long their child would be imprisoned.
Towards evening the father succeeded in seeing
the commandant, who told him his daughter would
be in prison for three weeks.</p>

<p>"I was not too uncomfortable," the poor thing
said afterwards; "one of the 'nurses' was
rather nice ... we were sewing the whole day
long ... but there were such funny women
there...."</p>

<p>I should think so.</p>

<p>Then what an excellent pretext for vexatious
measures was this enforced service! A rich
landowner of Vivaise, who was ill, sent a servant
of his, old but able-bodied, to take his place. One
morning the officer asked:</p>

<p>"Why does M. Villars not come himself?"</p>

<p>"He is ill."</p>

<p>"He is not so ill as you are pleased to say.
He must come, and we will see what occupation
he is fit for."</p>

<p>M. Villars had to yield, and by way of an easy
little job he was ordered to clean the soldiers'
closet, and gather up dung on the road. Ah,
the enslavers knew how to rouse our wrath, and
more than one Prussian well-nigh paid with his
life for his insolence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>If our men strove hard to be always submissive
it is because they knew that a single
attempt at revolt might have caused the village
to be set on fire and the inhabitants dispersed.
Yet once a worker had a quarrel with a Prussian.
He was a youth of eighteen, who, when he had
seen the convoys go away, had cried for rage
and clenched his fists, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, if I were but allowed to go ... within
eight days I should wear red trousers!"</p>

<p>He did not know that red trousers were blue
now, but he meant well, and this young fellow
one evening gave a sharp answer to one of the
soldiers who supervised the work of the fields.
The Prussian, not quick at the answer, aimed his
revolver at him. The boy stooped down, and
the bullet was lost in a bush. At the same time
a sudden collective rage seized upon the companions
of the young man, who had listened to
the quarrel a few steps away. Armed with hay-forks,
scythes and spades, they rushed headlong
upon the common enemy, who bounded forward
and fled across the country. It was a splendid
chase: Jacques Bonhomme pursuing Michael.
With the whole band at his heels, the Prussian
raced across fields and meadows, cleared the
hedges, crossed the brooks, got to the village, and
went to earth. The pursuers stopped and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
at one another. "What were we going to do?"
With a sheepish look and their arms dangling,
they went home more than ever depressed beneath
a feeling of helplessness.</p>

<p>Our tyrants were not content with worrying
us with passports and enforced service. They
continued to strip us methodically, poor shorn
lambs as we were, to whom the wind was not
tempered but whose food was strictly measured.
Though the Germans had taken all the fruits of
the fields, they were still afraid that something
might be left us to eat. So the farmers' wives
were forced during the summer to reconstitute
their poultry yards. All birds were counted and
requisitioned. Besides, the farmers had to deliver
to the <i>Kommandantur</i> as many eggs as they had
hens every fourth day.</p>

<p>"What are we to do if the hens lay no eggs?"</p>

<p>"Do as you will," replied the Germans.</p>

<p>The fruit-trees in the orchards and gardens
looked promising. We all rejoiced at it. "If
we have nothing else to eat we shall have marmalade."
But the first rosy tint had hardly spread
over the cheeks of the apples, when the rural
constable proclaimed throughout the village:
"When good and ripe, fallen apples should be
brought to the <i>Bureau</i>; a severe penalty will
be enforced on the refractory persons."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Germans still thought that we might
cheat them, and the fruit was unripe when they
began to gather it. Children from twelve to
sixteen were requisitioned, and under the supervision
of two soldiers they knocked down the plums
and picked them up. A month later it was the
turn of the apples, and then of the pears. The
Germans carried off the fruit throughout the
country, and we saw hundreds of carts go by
loaded with sacks of apples, which were conveyed
to Germany.</p>

<p>Among the most troublesome announcements
made to the amazed parish&mdash;always with a threat
against refractory persons&mdash;I must recall that
which forbade them to cut down grass along roads
and paths. This annoyed particularly the owners
of rabbits, goats, and kids; the animals were
requisitioned, but as long as the Germans were not
in need of them the peasant had to take charge
of them&mdash;had the use of them, if I may say
so. And it was no trifle to feed the cattle, as the
provender was requisitioned.</p>

<p>In Mme. Lantois' big shed the Germans had
heaped up a great deal of hay, and towards evening
the farmer's wife used to stand on her threshold,
and, after a glance to the right and left, she would
run to the shed, gather up an armful of hay, and
come back home in a hurry. "My poor beasts,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
she said, "I can't give them enough to eat.
When I hear them move about of nights it nearly
breaks my heart; it prevents me from sleeping,
it does."</p>

<p>In the autumn the potatoes were dug up and
sent to the north. The peasants were furious.
One of them, busy digging in his own field behind
his house, muttered between his teeth: "Isn't
it a shame! The very potatoes I have planted
myself! And I shan't have any! Wait a
minute!"</p>

<p>He had on a large belt that transformed the
upper part of his shirt into a sack. His hand
went by turns down to the ground and up to his
neck, and he soon had the figure of Punch. While
the guard studied the weather, his nose lifted up
towards the sky, the man sneaked away, slipped
into his house, emptied his belt, came back,
and began again. Alas, came the moment when
the guard discovered the trick!</p>

<p>This guard was a holy man, fat, stout, demure-looking,
a canting preacher, who not only took
the apostleship of his nation for granted, but his
own too. When the misappropriated potatoes
had got back to the Prussian sacks our Mr.
Smooth-Tongue looked at the grieved culprit&mdash;grieved
at having been caught&mdash;looked at the
hollow-cheeked faces around him, at the sunken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
jaded eyes. He paused before speaking, tossed
his head three times, and said: "How perverse
are the French! Don't you know that stealing
is forbidden? And don't you know that the
potatoes belong to the Germans? Now then,
by taking our potatoes you commit a theft. It
is a disgrace. Be sure you never do such a thing
again!" Such talk was to be heard from many
Germans. It suits them. I delight in hearing
them sing this tune, the <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i>
at their head, and cry up to the skies the good,
the beautiful. They go still further, and my joy
increases. They laud the love of their neighbour,
respect for the property of others, compassion
towards the weak; they extol the meekness, the
goodness, the infinite sweet temper of Germany.
But oh! it is ever to be regretted that so many
noble words should be delivered in vain. Such
rubbish does not take with us.</p>

<p>"Their <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i>!" exclaimed a
farmer's wife. "We buy it only to read the list
of French prisoners, and because there is no other
newspaper. But when my husband reads it,
he never leaves off thumping on the table, and
rapping out oaths from beginning to end. Since
those filthy fellows have settled themselves down
here, one has never a fine word in one's mouth!"</p>

<p>"The other day," another woman told us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>,
"my husband had to bring vegetables to Laon.
He went to have his pass signed; the sergeant
held out his hand to take the paper and said:
'Well, comrade?' My husband gave no answer,
but he thought to himself: 'You my comrade!
I would rather kick you soundly than call you
that.'"</p>

<p>Our sense of impotence was never greater than
in the month of August, when the Germans
trumpeted abroad with a sneer the defeat of
the Russians, and oh, sacrilege! ordered our own
bells to be rung to celebrate the glorious deeds of
the German army! But in September hope rose
in our hearts, and filled them with joy. The
offensive began in Champagne. The cannon
raged as never before. How they rolled and
shook and roared! And to our minds the uproar
was suave, the rumbling was blessed.</p>

<p>The French aeroplanes came eight days running
to drop bombs on the station at Laon. Six,
seven, even ten were to be seen at the same time
in the sky; they sparkled like jewels in the deep-blue
heavens; they well-nigh drove us mad;
we jumped for joy in the garden, cheered them,
and would gladly have thrown our hearts out
to them. Fortunately no outsiders were the
witnesses of our frenzy, or we should have been
found guilty. At Laon, two young girls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
looking out of an upper window, and at the sight
of the dear aeroplanes had screamed with joy,
and clapped their hands. Alas, some soldiers
saw them from the street, and lodged an information
against them! They were immediately
arrested, tried, and sentenced to a month's
imprisonment. We lived in hope for a whole
week. The <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i> suppressed the
French official reports which they generally gave
at full length&mdash;at least so they said&mdash;and we
thought that the offensive, even in the Germans'
opinion, bade fair to succeed. Then the cannon
was silent once more, and our hearts sank within
us.</p>

<p>The fair weather was past. It was cold and
rainy, and again, as the year before, we gathered
every evening around the lamp&mdash;a horrid, evil-smelling
horse-oil lamp. Our circle was often
out of spirits; our very gestures revealed weariness.
Thirteen months of captivity lay heavy
on us, and we had received no news whatever of
those we loved:</p>

<p>"Oh, they are all dead!" sighed Colette.</p>

<p>Yet we reposed the strictest confidence in our
army. We felt sure victory would ultimately be
ours. But, oh! how long was victory in coming!</p>

<p>It was cold and damp. We were afraid of the
coming winter. Though the summer had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
us many hardships, yet we had made shift to live;
but how could we manage in the bad season,
when we had neither fuel nor vegetables? They
had refused us permission to cut down trees in our
own woods, though the invaders had massacred
them at will. Besides, the Germans chose this
very moment to threaten us with enforced service.
We were told that we were no longer allowed to
get other persons to supply our places as day
labourers.</p>

<p>"The substitutes you find prove that they are
still able-bodied. So they must work for their
own account, and you for yours."</p>

<p>"Oh!" we moaned, "is there no means of
escape from this hell?"</p>

<p>We had made several attempts, had addressed
petitions, and written letters that had been
either thrown away or answered with a negative.
And now they wanted to add penal servitude to
imprisonment! They would oblige us to work
from morning till night, in the mud, in the rain.</p>

<p>"I prefer going to Chalandry," Geneviève
repeated.</p>

<p>But we were excused enforced service, and
exempted from prison. A greater misfortune
spared us these troubles. One morning I met
in the passage two callers who did not ask for
Jackdaw's Legs. One of them, very tall, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
thin, and very stiff, with Japanese-like features,
bent himself down with a low bow. His companion,
smaller but just as thin and stiff, copied
him hastily.</p>

<p>"Madam," lisped the former in a faint voice,
"I should like to see the owner of this house."</p>

<p>I showed both men in, and rushed into my
mother-in-law's bedroom. Everybody was in a
stir.</p>

<p>"What do they want? This visit foretells no
good, of course."</p>

<p>"It is the general's son," Colette said. "I
had him pointed out to me a few days ago."</p>

<p>Mme. Valaine walked into the dining-room,
where the visitors were waiting. On tip-toe we
went into the passage, and holding our breaths
anxiously listened from behind the door.</p>

<p>As soon as my mother-in-law entered the
room, the officers got up, and bowed themselves
at right angles. Then the lisping voice began:</p>

<p>"Madam, I am a staff officer. I have been
ordered to inform you of a decision that concerns
you nearly...."</p>

<p>"Ah!..."</p>

<p>Behind the door left ajar we strained uneasy
ears; the speaker went on with his speech:</p>

<p>"You are not ignorant, madam, of the
painful necessities of the war, and I am sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
to have to tell you that we are in need of your
house...."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>It was Geneviève who uttered this stifled cry.
Mme. Valaine had no voice to answer.</p>

<p>The orator continued:</p>

<p>"... We are in need of your house for a
printing office. It corresponds exactly with our
wishes."</p>

<p>"But it is my own house; I live in it with my
family. I have a right to stay in it...."</p>

<p>"Madam, I am very sorry, but we want it.
To-day is Thursday; I think we can wait till
Monday next to take possession of the place."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible ... my furniture...."</p>

<p>"Oh, the house must remain furnished. But
you may take away such pieces of furniture as the
officers do not want."</p>

<p>"But, sir, it is a disgrace!" Geneviève, unable
to control her indignation any longer, had
pushed the door open, thus unmasking our group,
and had entered the lists. Her invasion slightly
disturbed the officer.</p>

<p>"It is a disgrace! You pretend that you
don't make war upon civilians, and you turn five
women out of doors at the beginning of the winter!
You offend against the law of nations. But it is
your habit. I know you by your handiwork!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Wholly unmoved, the executioner replied:</p>

<p>"I see you are excited, and I shall not repeat
what I have just heard."</p>

<p>"What! Indeed! You may repeat it if you
like. I should not be afraid to say so to anybody."</p>

<p>Always calm and stiff and lisping, the Japanese
blond went back to what he was saying:</p>

<p>"You will be quieter by and by. I said we
want the house to be free on Monday next. As
we may stay in France for months, and even for
years, it is our duty to settle things as well as can
be. It is our right. I am sorry this is disagreeable
for you, but it is war." When he had done
talking, he bowed himself to the ground, his
companion immediately did the like, and both
withdrew. In a death-like silence we listened to
the retreating steps, to the gate slammed-to, and
then burst out into lamentations. A fortnight
after we were in Laon.</p>

<p>The dear old house, the garden, the furniture
were all violated, lost. As nothing else kept us in
Morny, we had asked leave to go to Laon, which
by way of compensation had been granted to us.
So, we should not be bound to enforced service,
and we could make up for the tediousness of the
winter by devouring all the books in the town
library. And above all, we should not see
plundered, and given over to the beasts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
beloved old house, embellished by our love, where
the family had lived for several generations, where
my husband and my sisters-in-law had been born,
where they had spent their childhood.</p>

<p>We should not see the looking-glasses cracked
by awkwardness or malice, the hangings splashed
with beer, the carpets torn up, the pieces of furniture
burnt one after another for firewood, according
to the whims of the servants. We should not
see the officers walking two by two under our
lime-trees, in our long alleys, edged with box&mdash;the
box, beneath which we hid our Easter eggs!</p>

<p>The rumour of our expulsion spread abroad,
and presently we heard the reason of it.</p>

<p>Jacob, the linguist, the pompous talker, not to
say the chatterbox, told the Lantois:</p>

<p>"The ladies' troubles are due to an officer's
vengeance. Lieutenant Bubenpech had a personal
grudge against them; he is the nephew of
the brigade-major, and he thought it amusing to
give these ladies a little lesson."</p>

<p>Very kind indeed, Herr Bubenpech! But we
know what a pretty thing is German vengeance,
and it gets home! And after all, life was more
easily bearable in Laon than in the country.
Friends of ours who lived near the Porte d'Ardon
let us have a little apartment in their house.
Our windows overlooked the country, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
usual we could watch the bursting of shells, the
captive balloons, and the turning beacons. Horse-oil
was faithful to our lamps, and we used turf to
heat our rooms. I recommend this fuel to those
who have a love of dust and smoke. The question
of food was hard, but not harder than in Morny.
Meat was scarcely to be had. The people dimly
remembered the shape of an egg, the colour of
butter or oil or grease or milk. Babies I know
fed on vegetable-soup alone from six weeks of age.
The American Board of Relief distributed provisions
similar to those we had enjoyed in Morny&mdash;250
grammes of bread a day, a little rice, dry
vegetables, from time to time a bit of bacon.
Besides, green vegetables were to be had at the
greengrocer's. But we were forbidden to buy
more than ten kilograms of potatoes a head per
month. At Morny the Germans had generously
distributed twenty kilograms a head, but half of
them were rotten, and then the population had been
told that they had received their winter supply.</p>

<p>What we appreciated most in the town was
the calmness of the nights. Where superior
officers are quartered, subalterns are obliged to
save appearances and to conduct their drunken
revelries in private. We had no more brutal
intrusions to fear; we dreaded no perquisitions,
as we had lost everything. And the aspect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
so many houses close to one another gave us an
impression of security, long since forgotten.</p>

<p>Yet how sad the town looked! Many houses
had been emptied according to the Germans'
whims. Furniture, bedding, linen, clothes had
been carried away. The officers loaded the
women who devoted themselves to soothe the
boredom of the war with presents, chosen from
among this booty. They adorned their apartments
with things they had taken from all quarters
of the town, and if they did not get from the houses
of the absent what they wanted, they applied to
those who were still there.</p>

<p>Thus it was that a sergeant and four men once
came to the house of the friends who had received
us, to fetch away a set of drawing-room furniture.
Protestations were of no avail.</p>

<p>"I have my orders. Make out an invoice,
take it to the <i>Kommandantur</i>, and a note of hand
will be delivered to you."</p>

<p>To any complaint which the wronged owner
might make an officer answered: "I have but
one word of advice to give you: Keep quiet and
hold your tongue."</p>

<p>The streets always swarmed with officers and
soldiers on foot and on horseback. All shops
were open by order of the Germans, but there
was nothing to be sold in most of them. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
articles of food were to be had, and the stock of
shoes, materials, and clothes was nearly exhausted
by the needs of the people and by frequent requisitions.
In November all silk goods had been
requisitioned, even ribbons above ten centimetres'
breadth. Many empty shops&mdash;which had been
plundered after the departure of the owners&mdash;had
been laid hold of by German civilians, who
had lost no time in bringing their little trade to
France. Thus you might admire a stationer's
and two booksellers' shops, a jeweller's&mdash;various
kinds of paltry stuff&mdash;a boot and shoe warehouse,
a hairdressing saloon, and so on. These patriotic
establishments were always thronged with customers&mdash;in
uniform of course.</p>

<p>The <i>Kommandantur</i> sold officially in a shop
thus installed Belgian lace of great beauty,
marvels of point: Brussels, Bruges, Mechlin.
After a month it was offered for sale in the town
hall alone, and so the sight of these treasures
was kept back from French eyes. The officers
scrambled for this lace, which, in spite of high
prices, sold wonderfully well. For the rest,
military men of all ranks spent a great deal of
money, and a French jeweller told us that private
soldiers often spent upon gold chains and rings
all the money they possessed. Was it a way to
convert their paper money into something safer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Later on they were forbidden to pay for their
purchases in silver or in German notes, and the
tradesmen were not allowed to receive anything
from the soldiers but municipal banknotes, and
were bound to give back only German or French
money. These rules were a great hindrance to
business.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1915, the magnanimous,
high-souled military authorities decreed that the
persons who had concealed wine&mdash;well-hidden
wine alone had escaped being requisitioned&mdash;would
avoid close searches and severe punishments
by making a statement of the quantity
they possessed. Afraid and tired out, many
people complied and handed over what they had
so long kept out of sight, and thousands of bottles
went down the throats of our tormentors.</p>

<p>More serious was the proclamation which
granted a delay to the French soldiers still in
the invaded territory. The blockade had taken
a great many of them by surprise, and had
prevented them from reaching the French line;
they wore civil clothes and lived under an assumed
name. Some of them had surrendered at the
beginning of the invasion; others had been
discovered and shot. But the new regulation
enabled those who were hidden to give themselves
up until the 20th of November. From that date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
every French soldier, caught in invaded territory,
would be looked upon as a spy and be immediately
shot. As many as eighty surrendered before the
stated day, and oh, desolation! the very day
after they arrested, in a suburb of the town where
he lived disguised as a workman, a French officer,
a captain. We read on the bills stuck up in the
streets that he had been shot in the citadel.</p>

<p>Another announcement threatened the villagers
more than the town's people. It intimated
that every criminal attempt made at
any point of the railroads would immediately
bring terrible reprisals upon the inhabitants of
the neighbouring villages. "Whether guilty or
not," the unhappy wretches would be "driven
from their houses if the military authorities
thought proper"; the women would be taken
away, and "the men enrolled in the gangs of
labourers." Besides, such hostages as the Germans
selected might be shot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the invaders were always
in readiness to drain the country of the little
money that was left. Many means were at
their disposal. Fines were showered down upon
the towns and villages. If a French aeroplane
dropped bombs on the Laon station, the town
was quickly condemned to pay upwards of one
hundred thousand francs. In October, to mark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
no doubt, the anniversary of the German occupation,
the invaded were warned that they would
have to pay a second contribution of war. The
chief authorities of the communes were told that
those under their charge would soon get into the
habit of paying tribute, very likely every quarter,
to the conquerors. "And when all the money has
thus been wrung from all purses, well, you will
but have to issue municipal notes, which you
will give to us, the Prussians. So, when the war
is at an end, when you have all been eaten out
of house and home, you will all the same be our
debtors!"</p>

<p>They were just as ingenious in fooling the
farmers. In that year, 1915, the peasants had
tilled the fields themselves. But the Germans
are scrupulously honest, as every one knows.
"We are going," they said, "to pay you for
your trouble and your corn. You will receive
twenty francs a hectare!" Splendid amend! Rich
indemnity! Morny was entitled to 18,000 frs.
"Yes," the Germans went on, "but you remember
that old fine of yours, which you never
paid entirely. Besides, there is the quarter's contribution
to the war, and a thousand francs fine
imposed for a passport that was not viséd. In
short, when it is all added up, you owe to us
800 frs." The civilians who had to listen to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
speeches hung their heads. The account was
right: they could not plead false arithmetic.
Two and two always make four, especially when
the German army maintains it.</p>

<p>This gave heart to the Prussians to go still
further: "Let us talk of the future. Next year
we shall cultivate the fields ourselves. Of course
it is but right that you should remunerate us for
so doing. Our tillage is worth fifty-six francs a
hectare. Besides, you must pay us our expenses:
three hectolitres of seed a hectare ... at the
highest possible price. We will be paid beforehand."
The sum total was 92,000 frs. for the
village of Morny alone. And there were about
1500 inhabitants left in Morny, all in utter
poverty after the exactions of which they had
been victims. Fortunately the Prussians put
the remedy at the sufferers' disposal: "If you
have no money left, you possess good pieces of
land, which you might pledge. We have just
founded a German-Belgian Bank in Brussels,
which will lend you some money." These honest
offers were made in the month of December,
but we do not know how things befell, for the
dawn rose again for us. Convoys were organised
for a second time.</p>

<p>We blessed the number of the <i>Gazette des
Ardennes</i> which, at the end of November, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
us the good news. Twenty thousand persons
were to be chosen in the invaded territory, first
among the poor and the sick and the people
whose usual residence was on the other side of
the front. We feared lest our demand should be
rejected, and we left no stone unturned to prevent
refusal. At length we were told that our names
had been put down on the list of the emigrants.</p>

<p>It was the end of the year. Colette still hoped
to see the French come back before our departure.
But, alas! nothing of the kind happened. Christmas,
New Year's Day, were kept as they had been
kept a year before, sadly by the French, merrily
by the Germans. Then the month of January,
cold and foggy, glided by, and we were still kept
waiting. At length the day of the departure
came. The convoy, the mass of emigrants, were
strikingly like the herd we had witnessed the
year before. Yet I think we saw more sick
people. There were many who coughed. When
once we were all seated in a carriage, we five,
with two little orphan girls, who went to meet
their grandmother at Lyons, the train moved
off at last, and such an emotion seized upon
us that no one uttered a word. The first time
our flight had been stopped at Chevrigny, a
second time at Jouville. How far should we go
now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>We had been told that there would be no
quarantine. Was it true? We were travelling
through a grey country. The night fell and the
dawn rose again: we were in Germany. We
made many a long stop in the stations; soldiers
distributed coffee and soup in the carriages.
We had taken with us, put by from our pittance
of a whole week, dry toast, barley coffee, and
licorice-wood tea. As to tasting "the soup"&mdash;no,
thank you. We peered through the windows,
but did not see anything worth looking at.
Towns and villages were gloomy; in the stations,
boys of about thirteen did the work of railway
porters.</p>

<p>The night fell again. We reached the Black
Forest, which was white with snow. We wound
our way up a mountain, and caught sight of a
vale far below us. The branches of the fir-trees
bent beneath their pure burden, and the cloak
spread over the ground was so dazzling that it
gave light to the starless night. Houses were
to be seen everywhere, grouped together in
hamlets and villages, or standing apart in the
mountain&mdash;good-natured-looking houses nestled
in the snow, with gaily-lit-up windows.</p>

<p>Then I cast my eyes about me. My companions
were slumbering, and the flickering light
brought out the paleness of their uneasy faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
One of the little girls was coughing, and we could
hear other people who seemed to echo back the
same sad sound. The long train that rolled
along was full of wretchedness and misery. And
from those snug little houses, from those towns
we had just crossed, came the soldiers who had
rushed upon our country. From thence the
plunderers, the drunkards, the debauchees, the
executioners; from thence came those who have
carried dismay into a peaceful country, who
have converted a happy, industrious population
into a fearful, enslaved herd....</p>

<p>May you be cursed ... cursed....</p>

<p>And there, in the big houses, in the towns, live
still the accomplices. They are all there. The
lamp is bright, the stove lit up. Dinner is over;
they are smoking their pipes and reading their
papers.</p>

<p>And in the invaded territory thousands and
thousands of people have gone to bed at six,
because they have no light, no fire, and no dinner.
And the others are there. They read the papers.
They praise whatever the German army does,
they admire the German soldiers, they approve
all high-handed measures, and those who are at
home, as well as those away from home, lift up
their eyes towards the sky, and thank God for
not being like the rest of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah no, you are not like the rest of mankind!
Could we shout it loud enough? Is there any
cry that might pierce your dull conscience?
Are there maledictions of sufficient vehemence
to penetrate the carapace in which you have
wrapped up your understanding?</p>

<p>Ah, I wish I were hundred-tongued, and
gifted with more than human genius, the better
to proclaim your infamy, the better to cry out
upon the sufferings width which you do not cease
to load us. I can but repeat what I have seen,
what I have heard, what I have borne. I shall
never be weary of lifting up a corner of the veil
in which you wrap yourselves, you dissemblers,
you false-faced, false-hearted men! On your
features of brutality and violence you wear a
benignant, canting mask, you assume a candid,
astonished look, and turn round to the neutrals,
to Europe, to all civilised powers, saying:</p>

<p>"We are charged with evil deeds! Look if it
is like us?"</p>

<p>You resemble the woman of whom the Bible
says: "She wipes her mouth, and says: I have
done no harm." You reject with a shrug of
your shoulders those of your actions which might
make you uneasy. Your accommodating consciences
do away with them, and they immediately
fall into oblivion. But we are sure to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
what you forget. You have shown yourselves
openly, and we know your real faces only too
well, their unrelenting harshness, their falseness,
their incomprehension, and in your double face
we spit out the horror and scorn you rouse in us.
And yet we admire you. Your presence was
attended with murder, fire, acts of violence and
plunder; you have displayed a powerful, splendid,
hideous bestiality, and it is that bestiality which
we admire in you.</p>

<p>Do not reject the title of Barbarians. It is
the only one that suits you. You might have
been fine Barbarians, but for a long time to come
you will be only shabby civilised men. I had
rather see you stand on a pedestal, and hear you
shout, exaggerating your misdeeds, overstraining
your cruelty, your vices, your animality:</p>

<p>"Yes, we are Barbarians! and then?"</p>

<p>Thus you might have been great, and since
you are strong, since you know how to fight, you
would have been like a hero who defends himself
as he is, and not like a little girl about to be
whipped, who tries to deny her fault, and weeps.</p>

<p>Believe me, you will cut no figure in history
as saints. Where your horses have trodden, the
grass will not spring up again for long. So make
up your minds, unmask yourselves, and cry out:</p>

<p>"We are <i>the</i> Barbarians!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>The train had reached the highest point of its
journey. All the vale, and the slopes of the
mountains, were flecked with a thousand brilliant
points. They were the windows of the houses,
more smiling than ever. A few moments passed,
and then a kind of excitement came over us.
Were we approaching the Swiss frontier?</p>

<p>We had still to wait in our carriages for the
morning. Long hours together we should have
to wait for our turn to be searched, and allow
the nurses to examine the soles of our shoes, and
the hems of our garments. But what did it
matter? We were in raptures! It was over!
Our martyrdom was at an end!</p>

<p>We were in Switzerland! We were free!</p>

<p>A fraternal welcome cheered us all along the
road. Here was rich Zurich, whose prosperity
dazzled our eyes. Then came Berne and fair
Geneva, at the end of its blue lake.</p>

<p>Here was at last ... oh, my heart, do not
throb so violently! Here she was ... France
... it was France ... unsullied France, where
no Germans breathe, living, active France, the
France that will crush the enemy. We saw
Mont Blanc watch over the frontier; then we
came within sight of the valley, of a rocky land,
and then of the plain, the plain as vast as the
hope which filled our hearts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>And now that we had reached France, now
that we rode in a French carriage, we sat close
to one another, and with tears in our eyes looked
at the landscape.</p>

<p>We felt heavy with an overwhelming joy, and
we waited for the morrow, not knowing whether
it would bring happiness or mourning.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
